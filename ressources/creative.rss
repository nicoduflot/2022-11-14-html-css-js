<p>Hello Apple fans! Kerrie, CB editor here. I wasn&apos;t expecting to start talking about amazing Apple deals for another week, but it seems like retailers across the globe simply can&apos;t wait any longer – the Apple Black Friday deals are here. Hurrah! </p><p>I should say, these early deals we&apos;re seeing are pretty impressive (and trust me when I say I&apos;ve seen more than a few to know when they&apos;re good), but the official Black Friday event starts next Friday (25 Nov), so it&apos;s worth noting retailers may well hold back their very best offers until then. </p><p>But if, like them, you can&apos;t wait to get involved, there&apos;s some cracking discounts around already. One of the best I&apos;ve seen so far is over at B&H, where you can get <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731146-REG/apple_mpq13ll_a_10_9_ipad_10th_gen.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$50 off a brand new 2022 Apple iPad (10th gen) – now down to $399</a>. In a vibrant blue and complete with 64GB storage, this is the cheapest you&apos;ll find this model on the web right now.  </p>
<a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1710352-REG/apple_mbam2sg_04_13_6_macbook_air_m2.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1210px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="CT9DVm9Ng7RsXki8Br2scE" name="macbook.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Air 2022 product shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CT9DVm9Ng7RsXki8Br2scE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1210" height="680" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>Well, the surprise discounts just keep coming. This time it&apos;s on the all-new MacBook Air (M2, 2022). Released in June this year, this powerhouse of a machine is a firm favourite here at CB, and right now you can <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1710352-REG/apple_mbam2sg_04_13_6_macbook_air_m2.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">get $130 off Apple&apos;s latest super-thin laptop over at B&H Photo – now $1,269</a>. </p><p>To buy this model, which features an 8-core chip and 8-core GPU and 16GB memory, directly from Apple would cost $1,399, so this deal will be hard to beat this Black Friday. </p>
<a href="https://www.very.co.uk/apple-ipad-pro-6th-gen-2022-256gb-wi-fi-129-inch-space-grey/1600803222.prd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RV5xjszaLtPdRp3DryaxpT" name="ipadpro.jpg" alt="iPad Pro 2022 product shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RV5xjszaLtPdRp3DryaxpT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>Time for you guys in the UK now. Once again, this deal comes on an all-new 2022 Apple product – and this time it&apos;s the turn of the iPad Pro. The <a href="https://www.very.co.uk/apple-ipad-pro-6th-gen-2022-256gb-wi-fi-129-inch-space-grey/1600803222.prd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">6th gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro is currently £1,319 at Very</a>, that&apos;s £50 cheaper than if you were to buy this 256GB version directly from Apple. </p><p>It might seem like a lot upfront, but divide this by the amount of years this device will serve you and it offers excellent value - especially with an extra £50 off. </p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation/dp/B0BDJ37NF5/ref=sr_1_8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Y3bWuxp84zD5utLpWYpRug" name="airpodspro2.jpg" alt="Apple AirPods Pro product shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y3bWuxp84zD5utLpWYpRug.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>If you&apos;ve now totally lost track on which AirPods iteration Apple is on, you&apos;re not alone. After double (and triple) checking, I can confirm the most recent model is the AirPods Pro (2nd generation), which retail at £249 on the Apple store. However, if these are the wireless headphones you want, you can save a cheeky tenner over at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-AirPods-Pro-2nd-generation/dp/B0BDJ37NF5/ref=sr_1_8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon UK, where they are now £239</a>.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Joseph Foley, taking over from Kerrie for a while as we continue to track the best early Black Friday Apple deals.</p><p>Now then, the Pro Display XDR is one of the most expensive products in Apple&apos;s current line up, so if you&apos;re going to splash out a small fortune for a screen, you really want to make sure it&apos;s when there&apos;s a Black Friday deal on. And right now there is, if you&apos;re quick. Amazon has the 32-inch Retina 6K <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-32-inch-Pro-Display-Retina/dp/B082M1P2ZQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple 32-inch Pro Display XDR for <del>$5,999</del> $5,499</a>. </p><p>Yes, that&apos;s still outrageously expensive, but it&apos;s a saving of $500 and the lowest price we&apos;ve seen in well over a year – Amazon last had the display at this price for a few days back in September 2021. If you can splash this much for a beautiful screen, you&apos;ll want to be quick though. There are only 16 left in stock right now. Just remember to make sure you have some cash left over if you want a stand as well – Apple famously sells the Pro Display&apos;s Pro Stand separately VESA Mount Adapter are sold separately – <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWUG2LL-A-Pro-Stand/dp/B082LQSZB8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">for almost $1,000</a>.</p>

<p>We were pretty surprised yesterday to find an early Apple Black Friday deal on the new Apple Watch Series 8. Amazon has the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHF757F" target="_blank">41mm GPS Apple Watch Series 8 for <del>$399</del> $349</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Always/dp/B0BDHW8P4P" target="_blank">45mm GPS Apple Watch Series 8 for <del>$429</del> $379</a>, a saving of $50. Not bad at all considering that the Watch was only released two months ago today. </p><p>Well, now there&apos;s good news for those in the UK too. Amazon UK has just dropped its price for the Apple Watch 8 by £20. That means you can get the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Watch-45mm-Smart-watch/dp/B0BDJG83L4" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 8 41mm GPS for <del>£419</del> £399</a>. The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Watch-45mm-Smart-watch/dp/B0BDHQYB3Q" target="_blank">45mm is <del>£449</del> $429</a>. Not so generous as the US deal, but still very welcome on such a new product.</p><p>These are the first discounts of any kind that we&apos;ve seen on Apple&apos;s latest smart watch, and they&apos;re surprising both for coming so soon after its release and also so early, ahead of the official Black Friday week.</p>

<p>Sticking with Apple Watch for the moment, if you&apos;re not set on the latest model, then there are some decent early Black Friday Apple deals on the Apple Watch Series 7 right now on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>It&apos;s Amazon again. In the US, you can get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Midnight-Aluminum-Sport/dp/B09HFGSRJ7" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 7 45mm GPS for <del>$429</del> $369</a>, though it seems discounts are only available on the 45mm in red. In the UK, Amazon has the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Watch-GPS-41mm-Aluminium/dp/B09HH8Z1JH" target="_blank">41mm Apple Watch 8 for <del>£369</del> £319</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="2jej42DroCmHtkX5BPDeJ7" name="MacBook Air M1.jpg" alt="MacBook Air 2020" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2jej42DroCmHtkX5BPDeJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ve been scouring the web for MacBook deals again, trying to work out what the current best-value deal is on an Apple laptop. For most people&apos;s needs, a MacBook Air will do brilliantly, and we mentioned earlier on that B&H Photo has Apple&apos;s latest laptop, the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1710352-REG/apple_mbam2sg_04_13_6_macbook_air_m2.html?BI=20811&KBID=16572&SID=cbq-row-6468634755897135000" target="_blank">M2 MacBook Air reduced by $130 to $1,269</a> for a 16GB RAM configuration. If you don&apos;t need that much memory, Amazon has cheaper 8GB configurations <a href="https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0B3BVWJ6Y" target="_blank">from <del>$1,199</del> $1,099</a>. </p><p>But the cheapest MacBook we can buy right now – and I suspect through all of Black Friday – is the previous M1-chipped model. Amazon has the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5KWB9H" target="_blank">2020 MacBook Air reduced by $200 from $999 to $799 in the US</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB/dp/B08N5N1WBH" target="_blank">reduced from £999 to £877.99 in the UK</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Qz3PnU3HebQKEdzPfaFA7f" name="MacBook Air 2022.jpg" alt="MacBook Air 2022" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qz3PnU3HebQKEdzPfaFA7f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I should point out that there are discounts about on the newer M2 2022 MacBook Air  in the UK too. The best price I&apos;ve seen so far is at Very, which has the base 8GB configuration <a href="https://www.very.co.uk/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-136-inchnbspwith-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-256gb-ssd-midnight/1600728340.prd" target="_blank">reduced from £1,249 to £1,109 – a saving of £140</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9rkutS43Nn6mpogqvKjPi4" name="MacBook Pro 14 inch 2021.jpg" alt="A MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) against a white backdrop, displaying an abstract blue desktop background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9rkutS43Nn6mpogqvKjPi4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like I said, for most people&apos;s needs a MacBook Air will do wonderfully offering more than sufficient performance, especially if you go for a 16GB configuration. But if you work in video editing or producing complex 3D visuals, then you might want the performance and efficiency of the M1 Pro or M1 Max-chipped MacBook Pros, which make smooth work of more graphically demanding work.</p><p>We&apos;ve been seeing savings of around $400 on some of the heftier configurations for some time now – those with 1TB or more in storage. But there are some big early Black Friday Apple deals on more affordable configurations right now. Amazon has the 2021 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-14-inch-8%E2%80%91core-14%E2%80%91core/dp/B09JQL8KP9" target="_blank">MacBook Pro 14 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD for <del>$1,999</del> $1,599</a>. That&apos;s the lowest price we&apos;ve ever seen since the laptop&apos;s release, and a saving of $400, or 20%.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="cPsCYyXW3cXbuy9vwWoeAi" name="MacBook Pro 16.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch 2021" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cPsCYyXW3cXbuy9vwWoeAi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you want a larger screen, I&apos;ve dug out the best early Black Friday Apple deal on the MacBook Pro 16 too, and again it&apos;s a record saving. Amazon has the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-inch-10%E2%80%91core-16%E2%80%91core/dp/B09JQKBQSB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MacBook Pro 16, 16GB RAM, 512 GB RAM for <del>$2,499</del> $1,999</a>. That&apos;s $500 off – again a saving of 20%. I&apos;ve just looked up the price history and can confirm that, like the deal on the 14 below, this is the lowest price yet for the base configuration of this MacBook since it was released last year.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, Kerrie here again. It&apos;s early morning in the UK, and I&apos;ve been dreaming of Apple deals. Lo and behold, I&apos;ve woken up to a deal on the all-new <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Watch-45mm-Smart-watch/dp/B0BDHV8MSH?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Apple Watch Series 8 – now £399 at Amazon</a>. Ok, so £20 off might not be the biggest discount, but anything on a product as new as this is not to be sniffed at. We saw some slightly better deals back in Oct (during Amazon&apos;s Early Access sale), so we may well see some more next week. But that&apos;s not guaranteed, so if you&apos;re after Apple&apos;s new smartwatch, this is a deal worth considering.</p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/2021-Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G968MFZ/ref=sr_1_3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2652px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Q2gxQ5Uo8BJ7WCShTFZKPH" name="ipad.jpg" alt="iPad 2021 10.2 inch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q2gxQ5Uo8BJ7WCShTFZKPH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2652" height="1492" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>Oooh, the Apple deals keep coming this morning. If you&apos;re on the hunt for an iPad in the UK, Amazon has a great deal on Apple&apos;s entry-level model. Usually from £369, the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/2021-Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G968MFZ/ref=sr_1_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2021 iPad (9th gen) is currently £309.98 on Amazon</a> – that&apos;s just under £60 off.</p><p>This isn&apos;t the lowest we&apos;ve seen this model (with WiFi and 64GB storage), it went down to £298 back in August, but it&apos;s not far off. The 9th gen iPad was superseded by a new, more powerful 10th gen version last month, but the fact that Apple has kept this around shows just what a brilliant little machine it is for everyday use. </p>

<p>Guys, these early Apple Black Friday deals are even better than I thought. So many 2022 Apple products are seeing really decent savings, and this deal is no exception. </p><p>Over on Very, the all-new <a href="https://www.very.co.uk/apple-macbook-pro-m2-2022-13-inchnbspwith-8-core-cpu-and-10-core-gpu-256gb-ssd-space-grey/1600728318.prd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MacBook Air (M2, 2022) has a £124 off the retail price (£1,369), taking it down to £1,225</a>. To get this amount off any of Apple&apos;s super-powerful laptops would be a great deal, so to see it on the latest offering is pretty special. It&apos;s hard to overstate the power of this unassuming looking machine – read exactly what it&apos;s capable of (in short, a lot) in our in-depth <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/macbook-air-m2-2022" target="_blank">MacBook Air (M2, 2022) review</a>. </p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Airpods-Charging-latest-Model/dp/B07PZR3PVB/ref=sr_1_3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ryZEGvxKAuJ53QMcLyg7Z6" name="content-pixie-RwvLuzb5EvE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Cheap AirPods" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ryZEGvxKAuJ53QMcLyg7Z6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5920" height="3330" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Content Pixie via Unsplash)</span></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>We&apos;re back to AirPods, this time a deal on a slightly older version of Apple&apos;s popular headphones – the Apple AirPods with wired Charging Case (2nd generation) specifically. Being a couple of years old now, you can get these super quality headphones for a really affordable price most of the year, but right now <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Airpods-Charging-latest-Model/dp/B07PZR3PVB/ref=sr_1_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon has a further seven percent off, making them a steal at just £129</a>. </p><p>We should point out this very same model went down to £99 in June this year, so this is definitely not the lowest price we&apos;ve seen them. Whether we&apos;ll see that incredible offer again over the coming weeks is anyone&apos;s guess, but we&apos;ll obviously let you know if and when it happens.</p>

<p>What&apos;s caught the eye today? Well, there&apos;s $100 off the new Apple 12.9" iPad (M2), which means you can <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731117-REG/apple_mnxr3ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_m2.html" target="_blank">buy the latest iPad M2-model for <del>$1,199</del> $1,099 at B&H</a>. This is a decent discount on this excellent new tablet. This is the 256GB, Wi-Fi model and Kerrie scored this one 4/5 stars in her <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/ipad-pro-2022">Apple 12.9" iPad (M2) review</a>. If you want the latest Apple tech for a little less, this limited time deal looks good.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1152px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E43j2rmJ3geZhKCo9e94kE" name="iphone-13.jpg" alt="A render of the iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E43j2rmJ3geZhKCo9e94kE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1152" height="648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here&apos;s a left-field Apple deal for UK readers. Phone provider Three is offering <a href="https://www.three.co.uk/iphone/iphone-13?colour=midnight&memory=128&paym=true">six months half-price on 24-month Apple iPhone 13 contracts</a>. This makes it £26 a month (first 6 months, then £52 p/m). The deal stretches to the older iPhone 12, iPhone SE 3rd Gen and the iPhone SE 2020. They&apos;ll also add in three months of free Apple TV. If you&apos;re looking for a new contract on a good iPhone, this deal is good.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1152px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PXkrBZHJ5y3zuxXbKBMr7o" name="apple-watch-8.jpg" alt="Apple Watch 8 early black Friday deal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXkrBZHJ5y3zuxXbKBMr7o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1152" height="648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not every early Black Friday deal is going to knock you down, but you can often find a small discount on tech you&apos;ve had your eye on. AO&apos;s offer on the newest Apple Watch 8 is just one of these. You can <a href="https://ao.com/product/mnp53ba-apple-series-8--41mm-smart-watche-midnight-sport-band---regular-95187-322.aspx" target="_blank">save a small £20 on Apple&apos;s newest watch – the Apple Watch Series 8, 41mm, GPS [2022] - Midnight Aluminium Case is <del>£419</del> £399</a>. This isn&apos;t a massive discount but it is Apple latest watch for a little less, and if you already wanted one, this discount is okay.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.14%;"><img id="TrgoSMYUAU2aXSb53MzyNE" name="iPhone 14 Pro Max-23.jpg" alt="A photo of the iPhone 14 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TrgoSMYUAU2aXSb53MzyNE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Basil Kronfli)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Save a massive $800 on a new <a href="https://www.att.com/brand/apple/iphone">Apple</a> iPhone 14 Pro Max when you sign up with ATT.com. The broadband and phone supplier has <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-14-pro-max-128gb-deep-purple.html" target="_blank">slashed its monthly price from <del>$30.56/mo</del> to $8.34/mo</a>. If you&apos;re mind to take out a contract this 36-month deal is a good one. Contracts aren&apos;t for everyone, however, so read the fine print ahead of taking the offer.</p>

<p>One of the most confusing things about Apple&apos;s brand new 10th generation iPad is the price. At $499, it&apos;s not that much cheaper than the iPad Air – but with <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731146-REG/apple_mpq13ll_a_10_9_ipad_10th_gen.html?BI=20811&KBID=16572&SID=cbq-zz-custom-tracking" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$50 off at <strong> at B&H Photo</strong></a>, it&apos;s suddenly a <em>lot</em> more appealing. And price aside, we were surprised how much we loved the new tablet in our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/ipad-2022">iPad 2022 review</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2652px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Q2gxQ5Uo8BJ7WCShTFZKPH" name="ipad.jpg" alt="iPad 2021 10.2 inch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q2gxQ5Uo8BJ7WCShTFZKPH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2652" height="1492" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple isn&apos;t exactly known for budget pricing, but by keeping the 9th generation iPad in its lineup this year, it&apos;s offering a remarkably cheap option. And with £69 off at Amazon in the UK, right now it&apos;s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/2021-Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G968MFZ/ref=sr_1_3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available for £60 off at just £310</a>. iPads don&apos;t come cheaper than that.</p>

<p>Apple itself has just <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/gifts/shopping-event" target="_blank">announced</a> that it&apos;ll be holding a Black Friday shopping event starting on 25 November. But rather than the kinds of discounts you&apos;ll find on this page, Apple&apos;s offering gets you a gift card when purchasing certain products (and further demonstrates Apple&apos;s curious understanding of the concept of a sale). </p>

<p>Of course, Black Friday isn&apos;t just about finding discounts on big purchases. There are plenty of deals to be found on essential accessories like iPhone cases – right now, Currys has a bunch of <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=1599&awinaffid=103504&clickref=cbq-gb-7846154999790383000&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fblack-friday%2Fapple" target="_blank">early Black Friday deals on iPhone 14 cases</a>.</p>

<p>We&apos;ve just seen a huge deal on one of our favourite Apple products to date – the 2020 MacBook Air. This 13-inch laptop comes with the ground-breaking M1 chip, and though it has since been surpassed by this year&apos;s M2 chip, as an owner of one of these beauties , I can honestly say it still deserves every one of its five stars in our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/macbook-air-m1">MacBook Air (M1, 2020) review</a>.  </p><p>Head over to B&H Photo to <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1604865-REG/apple_z12b_mgne_05_bh_13_3_macbook_air_with.html?sc_src=email_31223&sc_lid=3110452&sc_uid=2EzTrfg0aT&sc_llid=2895788&sc_customer=E1BC8A72ABCFCE08E7476407E97C96905B05CAE06F84AAC5FEE012412E2D3F70&utm_medium=Email%2031223&utm_campaign=Holiday%202022&utm_source=221116_HLD_HLD_Holiday_Apple%2020221116&utm_content=&utm_term=IMAGE%20md_749.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">save $250 on the MacBook Air (M1, 2020)</a> now. </p><p>Don&apos;t need the high specs of the model above?

<p>We&apos;ve been trawling through the web all day for great Apple deals, and every time we think things are starting to slow down, another great offer arrives. This time it&apos;s the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1694669-REG/apple_ipadair64wifi_ipad_air_5th_gen.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">5th gen iPad Air, which has $50 off at B&H Photo taking it down to $549</a>. It might not seem like much, in the grand scheme of things, but Apple has shown this little tablet a lot of love in recent years, and there&apos;s a whole lot of power in that super-thin design. When you add up how much use you&apos;ll get out of it, and for how long, this deal offers excellent value for money.  </p>
<a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/apple-watch-series-7-blue-aluminium-with-abyss-blue-sports-band-41-mm-10231247.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t592GQfL8o9DTFM9sYYUud" name="apple7.jpg" alt="Apple Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t592GQfL8o9DTFM9sYYUud.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>The Apple Watch 7 is only just over a year old, and yet you can <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/apple-watch-series-7-blue-aluminium-with-abyss-blue-sports-band-41-mm-10231247.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">get it right now at Currys for just £309 – saving £50 on the retail price</a>. This particular model is 41mm in size, and available in either midnight blue and khaki green aluminium, with respective sports band. It might not be the shiny new Apple Watch 8, but it has a load of the same features for a lot less (and looks almost identical too!). </p>

<p>Incase you missed it earlier, one of the best Apple Black Friday deals we&apos;ve seen so far is the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1664329-REG/apple_mk2k3ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_64gb.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">9th gen iPad for $304 at B&H Photo</a> – that&apos;s a $25 saving on the retail price. It might not seem like much, but $329 for this hardy little machine was already an absolute bargain so a further reduction makes this an excellent offer. It&apos;s not be its cheapest-ever price, but it&apos;s only $5 more than the lowest we&apos;ve seen it at, so even if it did go down to it&apos;s all-time low again, you&apos;re not losing much. </p>

<p>This is Joe taking over from Kerrie for a couple of hours now. Some of the highlights of this evening – I&apos;m hoping – are going to come from Amazon in the UK. It&apos;s officially starting its Black Friday week on Friday, which means in just 15 minutes&apos; time. Most of the best Apple Black Friday deals we&apos;ve seen so far have been in the US, so I&apos;m hoping Amazon might turn things around a bit.</p><p>So far in the UK, Very is already running what it&apos;s calling Apple Black Friday deals, and there are a few things well worth considering there, including <a href="https://www.very.co.uk/apple-iphone-13-pro-256gb-graphite/1600648841.prd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£30 off the iPhone 13 Pro, now £1,019</a>. No, not exactly a ground breaking deal, but it&apos;s not that often we see any discount on a sim-free iPhone.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AXVdrWuudnYfDCcPFbDLWB" name="Apple Watch.jpg" alt="Apple Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AXVdrWuudnYfDCcPFbDLWB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So we&apos;re off. Amazon has officially started its Black Friday sale in the UK and the first deals are... erm... a little disappointing. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Watch-41mm-Smart-watch/dp/B0BDJG83L4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£10 off Apple Watch Series 7? (now from £389)?</a>. Come on Amazon, you can do better than that! </p><p>It already had <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Watch-41mm-Smart-watch/dp/B0BDJG83L4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£20 off the Apple Watch Series 8 (now from £399)</a>. This year&apos;s Watch might not be a massive upgrade over the Series 7, but with a difference of only £10, I know which one I&apos;d go for – and it&apos;s not the one that Amazon&apos;s claiming as a Black Friday deal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="WyHqHccQ8Cto8UtMhSTFoB" name="1668731746.jpg" alt="iPhone Black Friday deal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WyHqHccQ8Cto8UtMhSTFoB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1608" height="905" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So there are a couple of other Apple Black Friday deals in the batch of discounts that Apple released at midnight in the UK. They&apos;re both on the iPhone 13. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPhone-Pro-Max-1TB/dp/B09G9N23N4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">There&apos;s £100 off the iPhone 13 Pro Max with 1TB storage now <del>£1,549</del> £1,459</a>. Is this a deal that it makes sense to buy? Yes – if you really need a phone with such big storage. The newer iPhone 14 Pro Max with 1TB would set you back £1,749. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="cPsCYyXW3cXbuy9vwWoeAi" name="MacBook Pro 16.jpg" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch 2021" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cPsCYyXW3cXbuy9vwWoeAi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I&apos;ll be signing off here on the blog in a moment, but we&apos;ll be back tracking all the best Apple Black Friday deals in the morning. As a round up, we can conclude for now that a lot of the best Apple Black Friday deals are not actually flagged as such. The deals that Amazon UK has just released with the Black Friday tag on them aren&apos;t really going to blow anybody away, but then it already had <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-MacBook-16-inch-10%E2%80%91core-16%E2%80%91core/dp/B09JQV24NM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£270 of the MacBook Pro 16 – now from £2,129</a>. Now, that&apos;s much more interesting.</p><p>In the US, the saving on this beast of a laptop is even better, with $500 off the base configuration – <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-inch-10%E2%80%91core-16%E2%80%91core/dp/B09JQKBQSB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MacBook Pro 16 with 512GB SSD for <del>$2,499</del> $1,999</a>. That&apos;s a record low price and probably the best Apple Black Friday deal we&apos;ve seen so far, but we&apos;ll be back again tomorrow to search for more.</p>

<p>Good morning from the UK! We&apos;ve woken to some knockout Apple deals, which we can&apos;t wait to share with you. </p><p>Amazon UK has today launched its official Black Friday week, and there are some bargains to be had. Kicking things off today is an amazing deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-MacBook-Chip-13-inch-256GB/dp/B08N5N1WBH?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2020 M1 MacBook Air, which is now just £877</a>. That&apos;s £122 off the retail price and only £2 more than the lowest price we&apos;ve ever seen it. </p><p>A few of us at Creative Bloq are lucky enough to use this version MacBook Air regularly, and we love them. Full of power, super-light to carry about and more than £100 off – what more could you want? </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="CyLLw5kjoJsEqMX5hU4reR" name="jJFSuDTwnzikXs4R5iqm5M-1200-80.jpg" alt="iMac (2020) on desk, with keyboard and mouse" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CyLLw5kjoJsEqMX5hU4reR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="916" height="515" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We talk an awful lot about MacBooks here on CB, because portability is such a draw for any creative. But we also know the power of an iMac is as intoxicating (we should know, we&apos;ve used our fair share). The epic speed and 5K Retina display are a brilliant but pricey option. So we&apos;re delighted to share this deal on a 2020 iMac, which knocks the price by a tasty 17 per cent. It isn&apos;t <em>quite </em>the lowest we&apos;ve ever seen (about £30 more than that). But it still brings the price <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Retina-display-27-inch-Storage/dp/B08F98M5VJ/ref=sr_1_8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">down from £2,299 to £1,909 for the i7 processor</a>.</p>

<p>Now, we heard whispers of discounts across the NEW MacBook range, but we dared not believe it. HOLD THE PHONE because one has just landed. No, it&apos;s not the biggest saving in the world but it is on the brand-new MacBook Air 2022 – and we all know how rare a deal on a brand-new model can be. <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/2022-apple-macbook-air-13-6-inch-liquid-retina-display-m2-processor-8gb-ram-256gb-ssd-space-grey/space-grey/p6264122" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Save £60 on the MacBook Air 13.6-inch with the incredible M2 processor at John Lewis</a>. Now down to £1,109 or £1,119 depending on the colour you go for – plus a very nice trade-in deal of up to £450 as well. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cKACjjna4XN5dFr86YEhy8" name="ipadhotdeal.jpg" alt="iPad mini 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKACjjna4XN5dFr86YEhy8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple/Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, you&apos;ll have to be fast with this one as there are only 10 left. It&apos;s the iPad mini 6 2021 (in gold) with a pretty marvellous £200 off the RRP, <a href="https://www.laptopsdirect.co.uk/apple-ipad-mini-6-8.3-256gb-starlight-mk7v3b-a/version.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">knocking it down to a very low £549 at Laptops Direct</a> (other colours are slightly more). Of course, that full price isn&apos;t how much it&apos;s currently on offer for everywhere, but it is the cheapest we can see it for at the moment by quite some way! (OnBuy has the Purple edition at £579 as the next in line, but Argos&apos; price for the Champagne iPad mini 6 is £619). Anyway, you get the point. It&apos;s a goooood deal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="v3WJiET9Xujee5yrfy934V" name="ipad 2022.jpg" alt="Product shot of the iPad 2022 in four colours" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v3WJiET9Xujee5yrfy934V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of our standout deals is selling out fast – that $50 off the new iPad 2022 in blue at B&H Photo is now totally sold out. BUT the deal on the silver version is still <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731145-REG/apple_mpq03ll_a_10_9_ipad_10th_gen.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alive and kicking at the low price of $399</a>.

<p>Hey, it&apos;s Ian here, and welcome to the first of many PS5 deals I&apos;ll be sharing with you as Black Friday starts early this year. While actual PS5 console discounts may be lacking there are some excellent bundle deals already appearing.</p><p>UK gamers can get a good value bundle from retailer Currys right now has a great value <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/sony-playstation-5-and-god-of-war-ragnar%C3%B6k-bundle-with-barracuda-x-headset-and-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-10244687.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5 bundle for £669</a>that includes with God Of War Ragnarök, Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare II and the Barracuda X Headset. This bundle offers two of November&apos;s biggest games with a PS5 and an excellent gaming headset.</p>

<p>We&apos;re back. Sorry for the delay, but finding good PS5 deals is tricky right now. Third-party sellers and price hikes aplenty means tracking down actual savings is much harder than you might think. But, patience is a virtue, right? And we&apos;ve finally found a deal that doesn&apos;t mean you forking out well over the odds. </p><p>Over at Game in the UK, you can get a <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/en/playstation-5-horizon-forbidden-west-2876269" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5 console and Horizon West bundle for £519.99</a>, which is £10 less than if you were to buy this bundle directly from Playstation. The cheapest we could find this game to buy separately was £40, which means this bundle doesn&apos;t actually represent any savings, but it what it does offer is value for money, and that&apos;s just about as good as it gets right now on Playstation&apos;s highly sought after console. </p>

<p>Good morning from the UK! </p><p>It&apos;s super early here and we&apos;re a bit bleary eyed, but the great news is we&apos;ve woken to lots of retailers in full Black Friday mode. So we&apos;re off to grab a strong coffee and have a hunt for more PS5 goodies – be sure to bookmark this page, we&apos;ve got a good feeling about PS5 Black Friday deals today... </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:679px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.04%;"><img id="DaNw3PSbWqbz8bQqWfTSST" name="quarry.jpg" alt="Cover art for PS5 videogame The Quarry" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DaNw3PSbWqbz8bQqWfTSST.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="679" height="849" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 2K Games/Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you like your videogames dark and bloody, The Quarry will be right up your violent alley. The characters aren&apos;t the only thing getting slashed today either, as Amazon has hacked a shocking 62% off the price for Black Friday, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/2K-Games-The-Quarry-PS5/dp/B09VXT3FGS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">down to £24.95 from £64.99</a>. That&apos;s well below the previous lowest price we&apos;ve recorded, which was £29.99, so this is a genuinely good early Black Friday treat for horror-game fans who like a touch of the cinematic. It&apos;s also being sold as <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/2K-Games-The-Quarry-PS5/dp/B0BL3CLVT8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a bundle with Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection for £42.94</a> down from £107.98, for those looking for a dash of escapist adventure to balance against the more murdery vibe of The Quarry...</p>

<p>After the news of PSVR 2&apos;s release early in 2023 as expected PSVR has begun to be discounted, and there are some good deals around this Black Friday. Of course this is Sony&apos;s older VR headset, but it&apos;s still an excellent device and has a large selection of games – and none of these will run on PSVR 2, including the excellent Iron Man VR. </p><p>At launch PSVR on its own was $399 / £349, but now you can get the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/playstation-vr-marvels-iron-man-vr-bundle/6439591.p"><strong>PSVR Marvel’s Iron Man VR Bundle for now </strong><del><strong>$349.99</strong></del><strong> $199</strong></a> at Best Buy. </p><p>However, my personal favourite deal would be the shooter bundle that&apos;s heavily discounted: get the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-4-DOOM-VFR-Bravo-Team-PSVR-Aim-Controller-Enhanced-Bundle-VR-Headset-Camera-Wireless-Controller/121452895"><strong>PSVR + DOOM VFR + Bravo Team + PSVR Aim Controller + PSVR Camera for </strong><del><strong>$479.99</strong></del><strong> $399</strong></a> at Walmart.</p>

<p>It&apos;s hard to believe, but people are still struggling to get a hold of a PS5 in many places, including the UK and US, but thankfully quite a few places have the console in stock ahead of Black Friday this year!

<p>Kicking off our Nintendo Switch Black Friday deals live blog is a UK deal from Currys. So far, all the Switch discounts we&apos;ve seen have been quite modest, and this is no exception. There&apos;s <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/nintendo-switch-oled-neon-mario-kart-8-deluxe-and-sandisk-256-gb-memory-card-bundle-10233210.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£20 off the Nintendo Switch OLED Neon with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe & SanDisk 256 GB memory card, taking it down to £349</a>. This might not seem like much, but, as mentioned above, Switch consoles hold their value, and so any discount is worth snapping up if its on the device you want.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re looking for the original Switch, Very in the UK has good stock levels and some decent bundle deals on offer right now. One of the most popular is this one, which combines a <a href="https://www.very.co.uk/nintendo-switch-neon-console-with-animal-crossing-new-horizon/1600462993.prd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch console with the super-popular Animal Crossing game for £296</a>. </p><p>The cheapest we could find Animal Crossing to buy separately was £37, added to the retail price of a Switch, and the total comes to exactly £296. So while this doesn&apos;t represent a saving, it offers both products at their lowest price possible, and it removes the hassle of trying to find, and purchase them both separately. It&apos;s also the cheapest you&apos;ll find this particular Switch combination on the web right now. </p>

<p>We couldn&apos;t do a Switch live blog without featuring this all-new limited edition <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1270004?clickSR=slp:term:nintendo%20switch:1:565:1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokemon-themed OLED console – £319 at Argos</a>. Released on the 4 November, the Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Edition console features art inspired by the upcoming game of the same name. Famous Pokemon Koraidon and Miraidon feature on the front, and a design inspired by the series&apos; iconic Poke Ball is featured on the back.</p><p>This edition is only a tenner more expensive than the bog-standard OLED console, which will be a small price to pay for any super Pokemon fans. Note: this price is for the console only, no games are included. </p>

<p>Any minute now, Amazon will be officially starting its Black Friday deals in the UK, and if there are any Nintendo Switch deals in there, you&apos;ll be sure to hear about it here. The most exciting Black Friday Nintendo Switch deal we&apos;ve seen so far in the UK is this <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/nintendo-switch-oled-white-games-and-sandisk-256-gb-memory-card-bundle-10234263.html?" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch OLED bundle at Currys for <del>£429</del> £399</a>.</p>

<p>So Amazon&apos;s first official Black Friday deals are live in the UK, and there&apos;s good news for those holding out for a Switch OLED. There&apos;s a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-Amazon-co-uk/dp/B0B2TBFWFQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch OLED + LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Classic Character Edition bundle for <del>£359.98</del> £335.57</a>, a saving of £30.</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve been scanning the quick links above, you may have noticed a delicious bundle deal on a Switch + Lego Star Wars game.

<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/NINTENDO-HW-SWITCH-CONSOLE-CROSSING/dp/B08NG46RKF/ref=sr_1_10"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6czKaTNwXb7c7bPo2pyAR8" name="switch lite AC.jpg" alt="A product shot of the coral Nintendo Switch in an Animal Crossing box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6czKaTNwXb7c7bPo2pyAR8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3200" height="1800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure></a>
<p>That&apos;s right! It&apos;s a Switch Lite bundle. Right now you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/NINTENDO-HW-SWITCH-CONSOLE-CROSSING/dp/B08NG46RKF/ref=sr_1_10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Coral Nintendo Switch Lite bundled with a digital code for the popular Animal Crossing: New Horizons from Amazon discounted from £262.40 down to £240,</a> saving you £22.40!  </p>

<p>Extra Joy-Cons are never a bad idea. It&apos;s great to have some spare for game nights with friends and family, and with the risk of Joy-Con drift ever-present it&apos;s good to rotate between various Joy-Cons every now and then. Amazon has discounted most of their Joy-Con pairs, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Joy-red-blue-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N5OORGV/ref=sxin_16_ac_d_rm?ac_md=2-2-bmludGVuZG8gc3dpdGNoIGNvbnRyb2xsZXI%3D-ac_d_rm_rm_rm&content-id=amzn1.sym.0b27cf19-b0d0-4bf1-9dce-b0a41b6c66ae%3Aamzn1.sym.0b27cf19-b0d0-4bf1-9dce-b0a41b6c66ae&crid=1WU81ULKM5S65&cv_ct_cx=nintendo%2Bswitch&keywords=nintendo%2Bswitch&pd_rd_i=B07VGY2LWT&pd_rd_r=8c2f5699-34d4-438a-bb59-5f1b53e342ac&pd_rd_w=25ZmC&pd_rd_wg=xACf1&pf_rd_p=0b27cf19-b0d0-4bf1-9dce-b0a41b6c66ae&pf_rd_r=TQ3J8S4BXW11YDJA7YZB&qid=1668765615&sprefix=nintend%2Caps%2C71&sr=1-2-e2b79f78-a3a0-4cac-b70d-2a5e4ae8e724&th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">neon red and blue Joy-Con bundle that is discounted from £74.99 down to £60</a>, saving buyers a neat $14.99. Yes, they&apos;re still pretty pricey but considering these technically double up as two separate controllers  we&apos;re not complaining! You can also <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Joy-green-pink-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B072BZ66JL/ref=sxin_16_ac_d_rm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">grab some other colour pairings</a> for up to £10 off if you fancy something a bit different.</p>

<p>Hot console deal incoming! This is the best deal we&apos;ve seen on the OLED so far as we&apos;ve yet to see it below £300 this Black Friday. But right now, you can get the <a href="https://www.very.co.uk/nintendo-switch-oled-switch-olednbspamp-nintendo-switch-sports/1600726354.prd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">white Nintendo Switch OLED with Switch Sports for £299 from Very</a>, saving you an impressive £42.99! It would be wise to snap this one up quick as I don&apos;t expect it to last long.</p>

<p>Okay, so this saving doesn&apos;t seem like a lot. But considering Sonic Frontiers only came out last week, I&apos;m pretty excited to see <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Frontiers-Amazon-co-uk-Switch/dp/B0BBS1JM2X/ref=sr_1_1_sspa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon slash the RRP by £10 already, taking it from £55.99 down to £44.95</a>. I&apos;m not a massive Sonic fan myself, but I played a demo of this at EGX and had a lot of fun with it and with the approach of Christmas this would be a great gift for any SEGA fan!</p>

<p>We&apos;ve yet to see any discounts on the traditional-shaped Nintendo Switch Pro controller, but PowerA are coming in hot with some great Black Friday Switch deals! PowerA have a fantastic line of officially licensed Nintendo controllers for the Switch and a bunch of themed designs are currently on sale from Amazon, saving buyers up to £19. I have a PowerA pad myself, and I absolutely love it. They&apos;re really lightweight and comfortable for long periods of gaming, and visually you can&apos;t fault them!</p>

That&apos;s a good price compared to the full price and the fact that big offers on Switch games are fairly rare, but for full disclosure, we have seen this game sold for £32.99 recently, so if you want to hold out for a few extra quid off (but risk it going out of stock), we might well see it drop a little further in the days to come.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Picking one of the best student laptops isn&apos;t just a task for the beginning of the school year. You might want to upgrade or replace your old machine, or maybe you&apos;ve only just realised exactly what it is you need from a laptop. Every course has its own technological demands, and a different laptop will work for different students. </p><p>In this list, you&apos;ll find a variety of machines perfect for a variety of students. Mostly, students won&apos;t need a mega-powerful flagship laptop, especially if they&apos;re young. They might simply need to be able to use applications that run online through a browser, or optimised to work on low-powered hardware like that found in schools.</p><p>However, university and college students might require a more powerful device. This is especially true if they&apos;re studying in a creative field, like visual effects or 3D modelling. Because of this, we&apos;ve made sure to include a decent selection of laptops equipped with heavy-duty graphics cards and loads of RAM. And students studying video editing or photography are bound to need a display with amazing colour accuracy and high brightness levels. These are tricky, but not impossible, to find on a budget.</p><p>We&apos;ve personally tested almost all of the selections below, spending time with the machines. Where that hasn&apos;t been possible, we&apos;ve included picks that have brilliant reputations. Want to know more about our process? See our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/how-we-test-laptops">how we test laptops</a> page. For students though, we prioritised laptops that offer value for money, portability and long battery life.</p><p>If you don&apos;t find anything that suits your needs in the list below, then luckily we have more dedicated guides if you had something in mind, such as products that can be purchased with the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/apple-student-discount">Apple student discount</a>. We&apos;ve also got you covered if you want ideas on <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/the-best-imac-alternatives">the best iMac alternatives</a> for a desktop computer rather than a portable laptop, and we&apos;ve picked out the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-laptops-for-teachers">best laptops for teachers</a>.</p><p>Don&apos;t forget that if you&apos;re going to be studying a creative subject, you&apos;ll probably need the right software, so see our guide to getting an <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/adobe-deals">Adobe Creative Cloud discount</a> or <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/download-photoshop">download Photoshop</a> for a free trial.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air (M1, 2020) is currently the most affordable laptop in the Apple family, and while its likely to be overtaken in performance by the recently-released M2-powered MacBook Air, the older MacBook Air is one of our picks for best student laptop as it&apos;s cheaper than the latest model by quite a bit, while still being an excellent performer.</p><p>In our tests it achieved well over a full day of use on a single charge so you can power through your day without anxiously making sure you&apos;re sitting near a power outlet, and it has enough ports to support most of the peripherals you&apos;d need at college or school, such as a mouse and webcam.</p><p>That fast and powerful M1 chip allows the MacBook Air to be completely fanless, which is ideal for use in libraries or areas of silent study. It&apos;s also been well optimized for a wide range of applications so regardless of if you&apos;re studying economics or video editing, there&apos;s very little that this compact, lightweight laptop can&apos;t handle.</p><p>See our full <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/macbook-air-m1">MacBook Air (M1, 2020)</a> review for more details.</p>

<p>Apple may make excellent laptops, but its old rival Microsoft has a brilliant device in the Surface Laptop 4, and it really gives MacBooks a run for their money. What makes this laptop so good for students? Not only does it have a gorgeous thin and light design, but it has an excellent PixelSense touchscreen that&apos;s a joy to use for creative work. </p><p>It&apos;s also got an excellent keyboard, powerful specs (including cutting-edge integrated graphics from either Intel or AMD, depending on the configuration you go for) and incredible battery life. This is as close to a rival for the MacBook Air as they come, so if you have an aversion to macOS then rest assured that this will serve you just as well.</p><p>Read our full hands-on <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/surface-laptop-4">Surface Laptop 4 review</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The Acer Chromebook 314 has everything that most students need to get their work done: a 14-inch display and over 12-hours of battery life to keep you working through the day, with enough juice to finish up any homework in the afternoon.</p><p>There are some compromises with buying a Chromebook, notably that Chrome can&apos;t run all the software programs you can run on a Windows computer or a Mac, but for most students that won&apos;t be an issue as many educational services are available within a browser. </p><p>As a trade-off, Chromebooks are less demanding than both Windows and MacOS which results in that impressive battery longevity, as well as Chromebooks typically being a lot cheaper than rival offerings.</p><p>Just because something is budget-friendly doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s underpowered either as we found during our review process that it could cope fine with some basic art apps when connected to an Android tablet, which is ideal for those studying subjects like illustration.</p><p>Finally, it has plenty of ports to support all your peripherals such as a mouse or webcam, and you can work around the minimal 32GB eMMC of storage by keeping a portable SSD or flash drive handy to save all of your coursework or homework onto.<br>

It won&apos;t be winning many beauty contests, but this laptop is perfect for students who need an economic device to get online and run Windows applications.</p><p>Budget-friendly doesn&apos;t mean underpowered either, as there are plenty of configurations available for you to select just how powerful you need the laptop to be, from a capable Intel Core i5 processor up to a beefier i7.</p><p>It&apos;s fairly spartan in regards to features, but its thin and lightweight design makes it well suited to throwing into a bag and carrying around school or college all day. It also has a healthy selection of ports so you won&apos;t need to remember a separate dongle if you want to plug in a wired mouse or webcam.</p><p>We would actually recommend getting a dedicated webcam as the built-in one on the Acer Swift 3 is one of its few criticisms, along with poor quality audio from the speakers, but the latter can also be addressed simply by wearing some decent quality headphones. </p>

<p>The Surface Go 3 is the most affordable 2-in-1 tablet in the Microsoft family, and while It&apos;s not as powerful as the Surface Pro 8, or even the older Surface Pro 7, it has a similar design and is more than capable of running low-demand software and web-based applications, making this an ideal choice for younger students.</p><p>It even comes equipped with Windows 11 so you&apos;re getting the latest Microsoft operating system, and while it&apos;s not as powerful as a larger laptop device, it can still run some design applications reasonably well. In our tests we had no issues using Clip Studio Paint to create a few digital illustrations for example, but this isn&apos;t a device you&apos;ll want to edit images or video footage on.</p><p>It&apos;s important to note that you&apos;ll have to purchase the keyboard separately (and stylus too if you&apos;ll make use of it), so the device is sold in its tablet-only form, but when paired with its various accessories the Surface Go 3 is more lightweight and compact than most traditional laptops on the market.</p><p>You can read more details in our full <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-go-3">Microsoft Surface Go 3 review</a>.</p>

<p>The Dell XPS 17 (2021) is one of the largest laptops on this list of best student laptops, but students&apos; needs will vary depending on age, course and educational level, making this portable workstation ideal for those studying more demanding topics such as video editing or graphic design. </p><p>Its large size means you can pack it with some seriously powerful hardware, with the top-spec model coming equipped with an 11th generation Intel i9 processor, 64GB of memory and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card. Not only does that make it capable of handling just about any task you throw at it, which also means it&apos;s one of the best MacBook Pro alternatives on the market.</p><p>We found the huge 17-inch screen&apos;s 16:10 aspect ratio to be useful for creative work because it offers more vertical space, and this also made skimming through spreadsheets during our tests much more productive too. The display also supports 100% Adobe RGB and 94% DCI-P3 colour gamuts, and has a 4K Ultra HD+ resolution of 3,840 x 2,400, making this an ideal choice for university and college-age students on creative courses.</p><p>We were even able to play a few rounds of Fortnite on it, so this can double as a light gaming machine for a student that truly wants a machine that can handle everything they need from work to play.</p><p>See our full <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/dell-xps-17">Dell XPS 17 (2021) review</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The Dell G15 might be a gaming laptop, but that makes it pretty well equipped to deal with a student&apos;s everyday needs, from playing video games during breaks or after homework is completed, to then utilizing all that raw power to run demanding applications or software in the classroom.</p><p>It&apos;s also surprisingly affordable for a gaming laptop. It&apos;s not the most powerful model on the market, but it doesn&apos;t need to be, equipped with 11th-generation Intel processors and up to 32GB of RAM. You won&apos;t be able to configure it with any of the flagship graphics cards, but you&apos;d be surprised just how capable the RTX 3060 model is at running AAA games and demanding creative software.</p><p>This makes it a great option for students dabbling with Maya or Blender, or indeed, many applications used within the industry to create games and 3D content. Sure, it&apos;s not as capable as a full desktop setup, but for something that offers portability as well as power, the Dell G15 is a fantastic choice for students.</p>

<p>The MacBook Pro 14-inch isn&apos;t just one of the best laptops for students right now, its also one of the best laptops in the world <em>period</em>. That power comes with a pretty hefty pricetag, which can make this difficult to justify as a purchase but while it&apos;s certainly expensive, let us reassure you that you&apos;ll be getting your monies worth.</p><p>The Apple-designed M1-Pro and M1-Max chips can run just about every application you throw at them, and while most rival workstation laptops often sacrifice battery life in exchange for power, In our own tests the MacBook Pro 14-inch easily ran for 17 hours without needing a charge. Even wilder for those used to using gaming laptops or workstations is that the M1 processors allow the design to be completely fanless, so you can work in blissful silence at the library.</p><p>Our only complaint is while the SD card reader and HDMI port have been reintroduced to the MacBook Pro line, there&apos;s no built-in USB-A port which means you&apos;ll either have to buy an adapter from Apple or use wirelessly connected peripherals such as a mouse or keyboard over wired versions. </p><p>Sure, it&apos;s expensive but for those on demanding creative courses, we would say this is the best laptop for students If you can compromise on price - it really is the cream of the crop.<br>

<p>The Acer Aspire 5 is one of the best options for students on a tight budget thanks to it being one of the cheapest laptops running Windows 11. That means you&apos;re paying near-Chromebook prices (which are praised for their affordability compared to laptops), all while getting non of the restrictions.</p><p>There are a few caveats in that you won&apos;t be running any demanding applications on it, but for younger school-aged children that won&apos;t make much of a difference. We tried it with Adobe Photoshop during our tests and it managed well enough for basic editing work for example, though anyone who needs something for video editing or 3D design will need to look at more expensive hardware.</p><p>There are a few setbacks that come with a laptop at this price, such as the inclusion of a brand-specific charger over the more common USB-C, and it&apos;s certainly not the most stylish device on the market but if you&apos;re looking for a Windows laptop at a very cheap price, this is our top recommendation.</p><p>Read our in-depth <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/acer-aspire-5">Acer Aspire 5 review</a> to find out more.</p>

<p>The Asus Vivobook S14 is well balanced for students on creative courses, which makes it a niche offering on the wider market, but ideal for handling low-demand creative applications and software on a tight budget. It comes equipped with 11th-generation Intel processors and a choice of either 8Gb or 16GB opf RAM, which is plenty to run most software a student needs.</p><p>Where most budget-friendly laptops are ill-suited for creative work, the Asus Vivobook S14 has been created to bridge the gap. It&apos;ll run Adobe Photoshop for example, as well as Clip Paint Studio for any digital illustrator, though it might start to struggle if you need something to edit a lot of raw video footage or render 3D models.</p><p>There are plenty of ports on offer to support a range of peripherals like graphics drawing tablets, with three USB-A ports as well as a Thunderbolt USB-C. We would suggest this as a better alternative to a 2-on-1 device for graphic designers as you&apos;re getting more power, and the support for a dedicated drawing tablet will be a vast improvement over those built into most affordable hybrid tablet devices.</p>

<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What should I look for in the best student laptop?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>One of the most important things for a student laptop is often portability - which means a light, compact machine where possible. While it can be great to have a mini home entertainment or gaming system in your student digs a heavy laptop with a 17in screen could be a real pain to lug to college and back.</p>
<p>Although we do recommend one 17-incher in our guide for those that need that screen space, it's fairly light and svelte for its size. But we'd generally recommend a 13 or 14in widescreen laptop as the best option for students. This will fit easily into a backpack or satchel and in most cases will be reasonably light. </p>
<p>You'll want to combine that with battery life that can get you through a day of remote study, and when the battery does run out, it needs to be able to be recharged quickly. You might want to consider an external power bank as well (see our guide to the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-power-bank">best power banks</a> for that).</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How much power do I need for a student laptop?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>How much power the best student laptop needs to have depends very much on what you're studying. If you'll only be using your laptop for writing essays and other documents, taking notes, watching and streaming media and maybe connecting to online classes, then you don't need much power at all, and a Chromebook or an affordable 2-in-1 should do you fine. </p>
<p>However, if you're studying on a creative course and need to run intensive software, you'll want more processing power and probably at least 8GB of RAM, if not more if you're doing video editing or 3D work that requires rendering. Design students may benefit from a laptop with a good graphics card.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What should students look for in a laptop?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Student laptops should be thin and light enough to be easily carried around, and they should also be built to withstand an entire school day in a backpack. Long battery lives are also essential, so that students don't have to worry about having to plug them in half way through a lesson.</p>
<p>These devices should have a high-quality webcam and integrated microphone for remote study. Many students are still taking part in virtual lessons, so making sure they are seen and heard clearly is essential.</p>
<p>Besides that, the specifications will be targeted to your specialism. If you need something more powerful for video editing or 3D work, the ideal laptop will have the capability found in our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/most-powerful-laptops">most powerful laptops</a> guide.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Which laptop brand is best for students?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>When buying a student laptop, you want a device that is well built, affordable and reliable. For that last point, it's generally best to go with brands that have a good reputation – you want your laptop to get you through at least your whole course of study, if not a lot longer. </p>
<p>Good brands for reliability are Dell, HP, Acer, Asus and Microsoft for Windows laptops, and then, of course, Apple. For creatives, Asus has its fantastic VivoBook range which offers good prices on devices built with creative professionals and students in mind, so check out those if you're starting a course for video editing or digital illustration.</p>
<p>It's also always worth checking whether your college has a particular policy or recommendation. Some recommend using Windows-based laptops to reduce software incompatibility issues or facilitate technical support.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Do Chromebooks make good student laptops?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Yes, they do. Not every student will need massive specs. We've included a Chomebook at number 3 in our guide to the best student laptops because for many students giving up a big storage capacity for super speed makes very good sense. The apps that Chromebooks run take up very little space, and with built-in support for Google Drive, it means your documents are all saved in the cloud as well.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Are hybrid 2-in-1s good student laptops?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Again, this is a resounding 'yes' in our opinion. Hybrids, also known as 2-in-1s combine the best of tablets and laptops into a highly portable package that's ideal for slinging in a bag to carry to school or university. Devices like the Microsoft Surface Go 3 at number 6 above are great for working in spaces where you might not have a desk – even on the train, while you can still keep the convenience of a keyboard for when you need it.</p></article></section>

We know Photoshop isn&apos;t the most demanding software, so it could technically be used on most laptops, but there are upsides to picking the perfect machine. On this page, we&apos;ve selected the top devices for photographers or anyone else who needs to edit images.</p><p>We&apos;ve tested all the laptops on this page, to make sure they can manage the dual task of being both powerful and portable whilst showing off a beautifully big screen. To find out more about our testing process, see our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/how-we-test-laptops">how we test laptops</a> page.</p><p>Photoshop works best with a lot of power, a modern processor and oodles of RAM (16GB is ideal). Added to that, using newer features such as Neural Filters and Sky Selection needs a GPU from Nvidia or Apple so the AI and machine learning can automate the (once time-consuming) tasks.</p><p>There isn&apos;t a lot of spare cash around these days for mega-expensive laptops, so our list includes some brilliant budget picks as well as some pricier options. While these cheaper laptops won&apos;t be able to run any of the advanced machine learning tools, they&apos;ll be perfectly suited to general photo editing using Photoshop (or any one of the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/photo-editing-software">best photo editing software</a> choices).</p><p>If you&apos;re planning to hook your machine up to a second screen for a productivity boost, make sure you pick up one of the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-monitors-for-photo-editing">best monitors for photo editing</a> too, and if you&apos;re a student on a budget, you should also check out our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/best-laptops-for-students">best student laptops</a>. </p><p>Still need to sign up to Creative Cloud?

<p>The latest MacBook Pro has worked hard to reclaim its crown as the most popular workstation laptop on the market, but it&apos;s done so with a flourish.  It&apos;s had a complete redesign since 2019 that has reintroduced built-in ports that were binned off back in 2016, now featuring three Thunderbolt 4 ports, one HDMI port, an SDXC card slot, and a MagSafe 3 port.</p><p>You can configure it to your exact needs, with a choice between either an M1 Pro or M1 Max SoC (system-on-a-chip), that combines the CPU and GPU together, though it&apos;s unlikely you&apos;ll need to max out the component options to run something like Photoshop. Whatever you pick, this is an absolute powerhouse that can run any application you throw at it, making it ideal for digital illustrators, photographers and video editors.</p><p>In our review, we were particularly impressed by the  14.3-inch 120 Hz mini-LED display, which is one of the best we&apos;ve ever seen on a laptop, offering crisp, accurate colour and delivering up to 1,000 nits of sustained, full-screen brightness, and 1,600 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>If you need multiple displays for your work then you can connect up to three Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV with M1 Max, or two Pro Display XDRs if you opt for the M1 Pro.</p><p>For more details, read our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/macbook-pro-14-inch-2021">MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021) review</a>.</p>

<p>The Dell XPS 17 (2021) is one of the best portable workstations on the market, especially so if you&apos;re not a fan of macOS. Dell already makes some of the best Windows products you can buy, but its XPS range is favoured by creative professionals thanks to its superior build-quality and powerful components.</p><p>You can get up to an 11th generation Intel i9 processor, 64GB of memory and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card to power through any demanding renders. Plus, for a 17-inch laptop, as well as being impressively thin and light to boot.</p><p>This is a shining example of just how great a Windows device can be for creatives, and you even have the option of buying with Windows 11 preinstalled. We found that the 16:10 aspect ratio screen is ideal for photographers as it offers more vertical space than standard 16:9 widescreen displays, and it can be configured with a 4K Ultra HD+ resolution of 3,840 x 2,400. </p><p>Perhaps most importantly, the screen supports 100% Adobe RGB and 94% DCI-P3 colour gamuts, which means this offers accurate colours as well. This means it&apos;s an excellent choice for professional photographers or anyone who wants their photos to look their very best when editing them in Photoshop. Read more with our full <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/dell-xps-17">Dell XPS 17 (2021) review</a>.</p>

<p>The Surface Laptop studio can be considered as a Windows-based rival to many of the popular macOS products on the market, and with Microsoft having spent so much time developing the Studio range these last few years, it&apos;s little wonder why. Offering Windows 11 compatibility and some seriously powerful hardware, this laptop has been well received by creatives across various backgrounds, from digital illustrators, writers and photographers.</p><p>It&apos;s got a thin and light design that rivals Apple&apos;s best devices, with a gorgeous screen that we found working in Photoshop a joy, plus excellent battery life so you can edit photographs or illustrate without worrying about being near a power outlet. But what most stood our for us when we used Photoshop on this laptop is the touch screen and stylus support that comes with the two-in-one form factor. You can slide the screen down to turn the laptop into a large tablet and then use the Microsoft Slim Pen 2 to draw or mask directly on the screen. A joy for photo-editing and illustration in Photoshop.

<p>The new Apple MacBook Air (M2, 2022) is a fantastic thin and light laptop for running Photoshop on, and comes with a range of improvements over the previous model, including a new 1080p webcam and a larger, brighter screen. That larger screen is particularly useful for photographers who want to see their snaps in the best possible quality while editing them in Photoshop.</p><p>It also packs the new M2 chip from Apple, which is a powerful bit of silicon that makes using the MacBook Air a real joy. It can also handle AI-powered tools in Photoshop thanks to that new M2 chip - which is the same as the one found in the more expensive MacBook Pro 13-inch.</p><p>Best of all, the MacBook Air (M2, 2022)&apos;s battery life is amazing, lasting over 16 hours in our tests. So, you can work on this throughout the day without worrying about being plugged into a power source.</p><p>It&apos;s not all good news, though, as it is quite a bit more expensive than the previous model, which means it&apos;s not <em>quite</em> as good value for money. The 2020 model, with an M1 chip, is still a fine laptop, and is still on sale. It&apos;s definitely worth checking out if the M2 model is too pricey for your budget.

Not only does it have a gorgeous design that&apos;s thin and light, but it has an excellent PixelSense touchscreen that will make your photographs look incredible. It&apos;s also got an excellent keyboard, powerful specs (including cutting-edge integrated graphics from either Intel or AMD, depending on the configuration you go for) and incredible battery life.</p><p>It&apos;s a fantastic showcase for Windows 10, and it&apos;s more than capable of running any graphic design app you want.

<p>Yet another MacBook on this list, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is a brilliant laptop for Photoshop, coming with Apple&apos;s powerful M2 chip, and can be configured with up to 24GB of unified memory, and this means it is an excellent, easily portable, laptop for photo editing.</p><p>It comes with the Touch Bar across the top of the keyboard, giving you quick access to tools and shortcuts, and can dramatically speed up your workflow, and it supports Adobe Photoshop. The boosted Neural Engine in the M2 chip means the AI features of Photoshop work extremely well, and can save you a lot of time by automating previously time-consuming tasks.</p><p>The new MacBook Pro 13-inch also boasts an incredibly long battery life. We&apos;ve tested it ourselves and it&apos;s seriously impressive, allowing you to work all day and still have battery life left. It&apos;s not as powerful as the MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch models, but it&apos;s more affordable, making it a great purchase for many photographers who&apos;d rather spend their budgets on camera upgrades.</p><p>Read our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/macbook-pro-13-inch-m2-2022">MacBook Pro 13-inch (M2, 2022) review</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The MacBook Air (M1, 2020) may not have all the raw power needed for 3D rendering, but it&apos;s ideal for students and photographers on a budget who want to get an M1-powered macOS device without spending all that cash on a Pro laptop. Given it&apos;s rocking the same Apple silicon as the previously mentioned MacBook Pro (2020), this is the first affordable MacBook Air that can go toe-to-toe with a MacBook Pro when it comes to Photoshop performance. </p><p>When we reviewed the MacBook Air, we found we could quickly open and edit high-resolution photos and projects, and swap between apps, with ease, all without listing to any noisy fans thanks to its fanless design. And of course, as this is technically a general consumer device rather than a creative workstation, it looks incredibly stylish to boot.</p><p>As with previous MacBook Airs, it features a gorgeous thin and light design that makes it easy to carry around with you, and also rocks a 2560 x 1600 screen that maxes out at 400 nits of brightness.</p><p>Also, for the first time in a MacBook Air, the latest model supports the P3 colour gamut, which means the screen can display accurate colours, a consideration that is incredibly important for photographers using Photoshop. While the new 2022 model, with improved M2 chip, is now available (and sits higher up in our list), the MacBook Air (M1, 2020) remains an excellent laptop for photo editing in Photoshop, and is now better value than ever.</p><p>For more info, read our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/macbook-air-m1">MacBook Air (M1, 2020) review</a>.</p>

<p>The Acer ConceptD 7 Ezel Pro is another powerful creative laptop that is a brilliant choice for running Photoshop on. It features high-end Nvidia RTX graphics, which makes it an excellent choice for people looking to make use of Photoshop&apos;s AI and machine learning-powered tools. The Pantone-validated 4K IPS screen is also by far one of the best we&apos;ve seen in a laptop, and when we reviewed it we found our photos looked better than ever - before we even fired up Photoshop to start editing!</p><p>It&apos;s expensive, and it&apos;s not the thinnest or lightest laptop on this list, but it&apos;s well worth investing in if you&apos;re looking for a real workhorse to edit your photos on.

<p>The Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED (2022) offers cutting-edge components, including a 12th generation Intel processor and also features an Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti 4GB graphics card, which means it&apos;ll have no problem at all running Photoshop.</p><p>The 14-core processor and 32GB of RAM also means this is an absolute beast when it comes to multitasking, which can seriously speed up your workflow. However, the most eye-catching feature of the Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED (2022) has <em>two</em> screens - a 14.5-inch 120Hz OLED mains screen, which looks fantastic, and a 12.7-inch IPS screen above the keyboard.</p><p>Think of that second screen as a super-charged Touch Bar, allowing you to move apps and tools to the bottom screen, giving you more space to work with on the main one. This works brilliantly with Adobe Photoshop You can also use a stylus on the second screen, turning it into a great drawing tablet. It&apos;s expensive, and the battery life isn&apos;t the best, but it&apos;s an incredible machine for working on.</p><p>Read more in our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/asus-zenbook-pro-14-duo-oled">Asus Zenbook Pro 14 Duo OLED (2022) review</a>.</p>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What makes a laptop good for Adobe Photoshop?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Photoshop is a creative application beloved by Photographers and digital artists alike thanks to its varied toolset and wide range of features. It's far from the most demanding piece of software available, but it's certainly one of the beefiest for photo editing. This means not every laptop can do a decent job of running it, but there are a few things to look out for when buying a laptop specifically for Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>Firstly, you'll want a modern processor. Both Intel and AMD list CPUs in numerical order regarding power, and the rule is generally 'the bigger, the better' so a 9th generation Intel i5 won't perform tasks as efficiently as an 11th generation Intel i9. We recommend at least a 9th generation Intel i5 or a Ryzen 5 3600. </p>
<p>Memory, or RAM is also important so look for a minimum of 8GB (though 16 GB is preferred), and even a dedicated graphics card if your budget can stretch to it. </p>
<p>A laptop with a large SSD hard drive is also recommended, as it means you can store all the photos you're editing on the device, while the speed of an SSD (compared to a slower traditional hard drive) means you can load up and edit the photos in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>Because you'll be spending lots of time working on your laptop, you'll want to make sure it's comfortable to use, so the trackpad and keyboard need to be well built, without adding too much bulk to the laptop. If you're going to need a laptop for Photoshop to edit photos while traveling, a thin and light laptop should be your priority. </p>
<p>A 2-in-1 laptop can also be very advantageous as it combines the fluid editing benefits of a graphics tablet with your laptop, though these tend to be less powerful than a larger, design-optimized laptop. </p>
<p>New developments have also appeared in recent months too, with more 4K OLED displays appearing on laptops specifically created with photographers and creatives in mind. An OLED screen will provide rich, deep blacks and beautiful colors, so while they might be expensive, it's worth every penny to get one if you can splash the cash.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What laptop do most photographers use?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>This is entirely down to the personal preferences of each photographer. Many choose MacBook Pro devices as they were one of the best optimized laptops on the market for creative professionals. these days, Windows based laptops and 2-in-1's have come a long way, but Apple still reigns as the top choice.</p>
<p>This is thanks to a mix of great optimisation and that beloved Apple ecosystem, making it much easier to use other Apple devices like iMacs Mac Pro desktop computers and iPad Pro tablets together in harmony.</p>
<p>Of course, if you don't have a bunch of other Apple devices laying around your home, Windows hardware is still a fantastic option for photographers and digital editors alike, especially if you're not experiences using macOS. Apple also has yet to release a true 2-in-1 device or convertible laptop, which gives Windows an advantage for folks looking to leave a graphic drawing tablet at home and instead use a stylus directly with their laptop.</p></article></section>

We&apos;re not sure it quite counts as one of the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/best-optical-illusions-this-yearhttps://www.creativebloq.com/news/deviantart-dreamup-aihttps://www.creativebloq.com/news/best-optical-illusions-this-year">best optical illusions</a>, but it&apos;s certainly very clever.</p>

<p>The book in question is Penguin&apos;s publication of the German philosopher Walter Benjamin&apos;s 1935 essay The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction. The cover of the book depicts its spine many times over, so that when viewed from the front, the book looks like a stack of several copies. </p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/InfraredSpectroscopy/" target="_blank">u/InfraredSpectroscopy</a> shared a photo of the book in Reddit&apos;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignPorn/comments/ywxi3g/this_book_cover/" target="_blank">r/DesignPorn</a> community, and it went down a storm. "Let&apos;s all own up, how long did it take us to realise this wasn&apos;t a stack of copies?" one person asked. "Quite a few prods to the phone screen trying to swipe to the next pic that would show the covers of this stack of books… talk about unconscious optics," another person said. "I thought it was a single spine and the book was just massive," one person said.</p><p>We have a copy in the Creative Bloq office, and can confirm that the cover is indeed very clever. Some have noted that the bad crop on the last spine in the row gives the game away. We assume this was intentional, reflecting Benjamin&apos;s argument about art&apos;s value being reduced the use of machines that have little interest in beauty. While machines themselves have evolved enormously since Benjamin wrote his essay, his concerns remain very relevant today, especially in the wake of the current controversy around AI in art. The book is available – still with that sublime cover – at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Ideas-Mechanical-Reproduction-Penguin/dp/0141036192" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>

It&apos;s a powerful program with tons of features, but while the interface is pretty sleek it can be daunting for beginners, and even experienced users often find they&apos;re not using the software&apos;s full potential – especially when it comes to shortcuts and other time-saving hacks.</p><p>Satori Graphics is well known for his tutorials, tips and advice for designers on YouTube, but one particular video of hidden Illustrator hacks is going down a storm. Over 320K have watched Satori&apos;s video, and many are saying they&apos;re massive grateful for his tips (see our own roundup for the best <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/digital-art/illustrator-tutorials-1232697">Adobe Illustrator tutorials</a> for more).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SatoriGraphics/about" target="_blank">Satori Graphics</a> regularly shares Adobe tips, but in the video above he recaps 10 of the best hidden Illustrator tips that he&apos;s shared to date. They include a tip for working in two windows simultaneously at different levels of zoom, a way to create a grid lightning fast and how to change default font settings. Satori also has a tip for how to see and control how many colours are in your design – handy if you&apos;re going to print – and he shows how you can turn a selection into a pattern that can be rotated within a shape.</p>
<p>Illustrator users of different levels of experience say the video has been a revelation. "And just when I thought I knew every little secret about Illustrator you come in and prove me wrong every single time!," one person commented on the video. "Surprisingly, they are also very useful tips!" "Some awesome features I didn&apos;t know about," someone else wrote.</p>
<p>If you don&apos;t yet have Illustrator and want to put these tips into action, make sure you see our guide to how to <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/download-adobe-illustrator">download Adobe Illustrator</a>.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It&apos;s one of the most recognisable logos in the world, and one of the easiest to draw from memory. And even after its latest &apos;redesign&apos;, it seems safe to say the above statements both still apply to those four Audi rings. But while it might be similar to the old one, it seems fans aren&apos;t thrilled over the freshly tweaked logo.</p><p>The car manufacturer has unveiled a new look for its iconic logo, and yep, it&apos;s finally joined the flat design party. The new monochrome symbol features those same four rings, but gone is the shiny bevelled appearance. (Looking for inspiration? Check out the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-logos">best logos</a> of all time)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="KHaqjKzZgui8KnMPoStC9g" name="small_3_2022_11_15_T08_51_12_802_Z_20f5ad25b1.jpg" alt="Audi logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KHaqjKzZgui8KnMPoStC9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The logo is no longer 3D </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Audi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new logo has already appeared on recent Audi vehicles, but the company is only just highlighting the redesign on its <a href="https://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/press-releases/more-purity-more-reduction-more-consistencythe-new-rings-from-audi-15041" target="_blank">website</a>, describing it as "More purity, more reduction, more consistency." Audi brand strategist Frederik Kalisch<strong> </strong>calls the design "on one hand, loud and very bold, and on the other, the restrained, pure, and clean," while André Georgi says, "The new two-dimensional look gives our rings a significantly more modern and even more graphic makeover, although their geometry is almost identical to the former ones."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pn5i2sw7uus4EziX8aLwCb" name="Screenshot 2022-11-15 at 11.41.18.png" alt="A man holding a model of the Audi logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pn5i2sw7uus4EziX8aLwCb.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Audi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But not identical enough for some Audi fans, it seems. Over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Audi/comments/yvbrih/audi_introduces_new_flatter_2d_logo_design_for/" target="_blank">Audi Reddit page</a>, users are bemoaning the simplification of the design. "Going the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/new-volkswagen-logo">VW route</a> I see. Shame," one comments, while another adds, "It really does look cheap. Looks just pasted on, as an afterthought." "What a disappointment. One of the things I liked about Audi is that they still used physical badges that you can feel and run your hand across," another user complains.</p>
<p>But while fans aren&apos;t happy with how the 2D logo looks on the cars themselves, that isn&apos;t, of course, the only application the company had in mind when creating the logo. "We want the four rings to look the same everywhere in the future: Whether in a magazine, on your smartphone, or a billboard – and on or inside the car," Audi says.</p><p>While not all fans are happy, at least the logo remains easy to draw from memory. That said, this isn&apos;t always a given – as these <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/people-drew-car-logos-from-memory-and-the-results-are-unbelievable">car logos drawn from memory</a> hilariously prove.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Although from the same brand, the best Dell laptops are surprisingly varied. Dell produces machines perfect for all hobbies, professions and budgets (including students heading back to school). Yes, you can pay through the nose for a flagship XPS workstation laptop, but the Inspiron series is very reasonable and often found in schools and workplaces. Basically, whatever your requirement, Dell almost certainly has a device for you.</p><p>Dell even creates laptops for gaming. Its fairly-priced G-series doesn&apos;t have the usual flashy designs, but has a look more suited to an office environment, but the super-powerful Alienware sub-brand is hardware designed for those who need the absolute best.</p><p>However, those devices aren&apos;t just suited to gaming. All that extra graphical power mean they&apos;re ideal for creatives relying on demanding applications, and they usually come with a bunch of ports so you can plug everything in for a remote working setup – from mice to webcams and more.</p><p>It can be hard to whittle down your choice of which could be considered the best Dell laptop. You&apos;ll always want value for money, decent battery life and the perfect level of power, but anything other than that comes down to your specific task list. Here, we&apos;ve rated our favourites based on extensive evaluation (see <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/how-we-test-laptops">how we test laptops</a> for more on our process), and we&apos;ve pointed out who the machines would be best suited to.</p><p>If you can&apos;t find what you want in this list, why not explore our guide to the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-laptops-for-graphic-design">best laptops for graphic designers</a>?

<p>The Dell XPS 17 will be a better choice if you love all of the qualities of the 15-inch model above, but you enjoy using a larger screen, which makes it well suited for creatives who will appreciate the additional real-estate.</p><p>That&apos;s because that huge 17-inch 4K display is ideal for editing 4K video footage, touching up photos in Adobe Lightroom and graphic design. You can rest assured that the screen is high-quality too, with 500 nits of brightness and 100 per cent Adobe RGB and 94 per cent DCI-P3 colour gamut coverage available at your disposal.</p><p>That beautiful display needs some fantastic components to power it, and luckily, the Dell XPS 17 is highly configurable, with up to a 12th-generation Intel Core i9 processor, 64GB of RAM and a GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card available.</p><p>You can expect around seven hours of battery life on a single charge, which was our only real criticism of the laptop given most of the XPS range has a fairly impressive battery life, but so long as you stay near a power source it won&apos;t cause too much of an issue.</p><p>See our complete <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/dell-xps-17">Dell XPS 17 review</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 3000 is an incredible budget-friendly laptop for those who just need a way to get online, but can&apos;t be limited to using a Chromebook. In fact, it&apos;s likely you will have used an Inspiron device at some point thanks to their popularity across schools, colleges and workforces because of how affordable and reliable they are. This makes this model an excellent choice for students</p><p>There are a good few configurations available, from 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, and a choice of Intel or AMD processor. That&apos;s clearly not going to be running 3D renders anytime soon, but it&apos;s a great choice for creative professionals with low hardware requirements, such as digital illustration programs like Clip Studio Paint, and you can always configure this with more powerful components.</p><p>The 15.6-inch HD display is pretty good for the price, and you&apos;re getting plenty of ports and slots. We would recommend this for students on a tight budget, but it&apos;s also well suited for those who are working from home.</p>

<p>The Alienware m17 R4 is, despite its name, a Dell-branded product after the two brands merged several years ago, and while it&apos;s marketed as a gaming laptop, there&apos;s plenty about it that creatives will love.</p><p>Price likely won&apos;t be one of them as something this powerful costs a lot of cash, but you&apos;re getting a lot of laptop for your money. The m17 R4 is equipped with a choice of either Intel i7 or i9 10th-gen Intel processors, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 or RTX 3080 GPU and up to 32GB of RAM, and those components make it well suited for 3D sculpting and game design.</p><p>The processor might be slightly older now that Intel has released its 12th-generation CPUs for laptops,  but that doesn&apos;t make them any less capable. There are also very few dedicated creative laptops on the market, which makes gaming hardware a more accessible choice for folks wanting to use apps like Blender and Unreal Engine 5 on the go.</p><p>The trade-off is that the battery life is extremely poor, and the design is certainly going to be a deal-breaker for some, but overall, this is a great choice for creatives working with graphically demanding software.</p>

<p>The Dell G15 is another gaming laptop, though this model will appeal to you more than the Alienware above thanks to its more palatable price tag and modest looks, exchanging an RGB-infested, alien-branded chassis for something that would look more appropriate in an office of classroom.</p><p>There&apos;s plenty of configurations available for you to customize the device to your exact needs, though you won&apos;t be able to equip it with the most powerful hardware on the market. Still, the top-spec RTX 3060 model is very capable at running 3D applications. It&apos;s a great choice for creative professionals and students alike who want a laptop with a little more power under the hood for playing around in apps like Blender.</p><p>The caveat is going to be both fan noise and battery life, but if you&apos;re happy to stick near a power outlet and make sure it gets plenty of unrestricted airflow then this is a great choice for both work and play.</p>

<p>The Alienware x15 is another great option for creatives who need a powerful, portable workstation. Its dedicated graphics make it a good choice for those working in game development or 3D applications, and the configurations are top of the line, with 12th generation Intel processors that start from the i7 up to the workstation-ready i9, and a GPU ranging from the RTX 3060 to the RTX 3080 Ti.<br>
<br>
There are even multiple options for the display, with a choice between either FHD or QHD resolution, with FHD having an sRGB 100% colour gamut rating and the QHD panel rocking 99% of the DCI-P3 colour gamut. There are even a few refresh rates to choose from starting from 165Hz, which could tempt some video editors.</p><p>As those high-end components might imply, this is a pricey product which is going to be a hard sell for those on a tight budget, and like most gaming laptops, the battery life can be lacklustre, but you have to accept some accommodations in exchange for all that power. </p>

<p>If you’re a student, you might have looked at the range of Dell laptops and wondered if there’s something more affordable.

It’s highly portable, making it perfect for taking to lectures or loading into a backpack. And if you want to turn it into a tablet, just detach it from the keyboard and away you go.</p><p>For sure, it’s far from the most powerful Dell laptop in the world, but that’s not the point of a Chromebook.

<p>The Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1 will be a great choice for folks who don&apos;t have especially high hardware demands and instead, value utility and portability. Its tablet-inspired design means it&apos;s well equipped for use with a stylus, so graphic designers and other creative professionals can make quick adjustments to their work on the fly, without needing to lug around a graphics drawing tablet.</p><p>For graphics, you&apos;ve got either integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics or an Nvidia GeForce MX550, so they&apos;re not the strongest GPU options, but software like Clip Studio Paint or Adobe Photoshop will run just fine.

We think it&apos;s worth considering over a tablet or something running a Lite version of the Windows OS, as this won&apos;t support all of the apps available on the full desktop version.</p>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Why should I buy a Dell laptop?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Dell makes some of the best all-around laptops and 2-in-1 devices on the market, perfectly balancing the technical specs needed by most users across a wide range of budgets. The build quality across both Dell and Alienware is very respectable, so if you're looking for a powerful gaming laptop, buying from either brand is a safe bet.</p>
<p>Not only are they offer top-of-the-line components and features, but they look very classy and stylish to boot, competing for looks against well established devices like the Apple range of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops.</p>
<p>If you have a price in mind and a particular area that needs to be optimised for your needs, Dell will have something that suits you, from 4K displays for photo editors, to beefy graphics cards and plentiful RAM for 3D artists and gamers.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What's the best Dell laptop?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>There's no one answer to the question of which is the best Dell laptop overall because everyone will have very different needs from a device. We love the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 for its portability and speedy components, but it won't appeal to those of you who need something with more power behind it for especially demanding applications.</p>
<p>The Dell XPS 15 or 17 are well suited for those who need raw power and a high-quality display, but size could prove troublesome for anyone looking for portability. For high-quality gaming, consider something from Alienware, a sub-brand of Dell that makes powerful gaming laptops, and for a real workhorse, look at the Precision range of portable workstations.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How should I choose the best Dell laptop?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>When looking for the best Dell laptop, you'll need to consider your specific needs. Dell's range spans all types of laptop including 2-in-1, gaming and workstations. Each have their own merits, but won't all be the right fit for everyone. You should consider whether you're always out and about (and need good battery life and a lightweight machine) or mostly in one place so portability isn't a consideration.</p>
<p>Creative professionals are likely to need a laptop with good RAM, a powerful graphics card and a fast processor so the machine is capable of handling technical and demanding applications. A laptop named as a workstation has the power of a desktop. If this is what you need, then the Dell Precision 5760 is a good bet. The Dell XPS 17 (2021) is also super-powerful, with a giant screen. It also goes without saying (but we will anyway) that those working with video or images will want to prioritise the display.</p>
<p>Students may not need the power of a gaming laptop or a workstation (unless their specialism is in a creative discipline) so could look for something that proritises value for money over power, such as the Dell Inspiron 15 3000. <br>
<br>
Need something in between tremendous power and simplicity? Our top pick straddles the gap, and is also a 2-in-1 laptop. 2-in-1 devices are usually less powerful but are gaining power all the time. Plus, you can edit high-res images using a stylus – a useful function for creatives. </p></article></section>

Thanks to new EU laws, Apple is required to switch to a universal charging port. But if new rumours are to be believed, the changeover might not be as simple as we thought.</p><p>According to Apple leakers, while every iPhone 15 model will likely ditch Lightning for USB-C, the capabilities of the ports won&apos;t be the same across all 4 iPhones. Instead, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will be the only models to support high speed data transfers. (In the market for new gear?

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NbcY6X7qySwh5BVkpsLAzX" name="iphone 15 pro copy.jpg" alt="iPhone 15 Pro render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NbcY6X7qySwh5BVkpsLAzX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A fan-made render of the iPhone 15 Pro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Matt Talks Tech)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everyone&apos;s favourite Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has claimed (below) that the new iPhones will "all abandon" Lightning in favour of USB-C next year, which can only be good news for creatives. The Lightning cable is over 10 years old, and with the iPad, MacBook and most third-party accessories shifting to USB-C, the iPhone is getting left behind.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(5/7)My latest survey indicates all 2H23 new iPhones will abandon Lightning and change to USB-C, but only two high-end models (15 Pro & 15 Pro Max) will support the wired high-speed transfer, and the two standard ones (15 & 15 15 Plus) still support USB 2.0 same as Lightning.<a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1593052344841011201">November 17, 2022</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div><div class="see-more__button-container"><span class="see-more__button">See more</span></div></div>
<p>But while the connection itself will change on all models, it seems Apple is planning to differentiate the Pro from the not-so-Pro once again in 2023. Kuo says only the iPhone 15 Pro will support "high speed data transfer" thanks to USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3, while the standard 15 will feature USB 2.0 tech, offering no improvement over Lightning. Nice.</p>

<p>For digital artists, this means Pro will likely be the way to go. Transferring large files is often part and parcel of being a creative, and those increased speeds could be a massive bonus. But they&apos;ll likely come at a price – especially if the highest-end iPhone <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/iphone-15-design-rumour">goes titanium as rumoured</a>. </p><p>With the introduction of Dynamic Island and an always-on display, the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/iphone-14-pro">iPhone 14 Pro</a> is worlds apart from the slightly underwhelming 14. And based on this news, it seems Apple is planning the widen the gulf even more next year. Don&apos;t fancy waiting? Check out today&apos;s best iPhone 14 deals below.</p>

<p>AirPods quite often come in for discounts all year round, so we&apos;re hoping to see some good Apple Black Friday discounts across the range this year. The latest in the family are the new 2022 AirPods Pro 2nd Gen. We don&apos;t have much hope of seeing a big discount on those, but the previous AirPods Pros could well see big discounts, along with the standard AirPods.</p>

<h2 id="apple-black-friday-2022-when-is-it-2">Apple Black Friday 2022: when is it?</h2>
<p>Black Friday is always the Friday immediately after Thanksgiving, which means in 2022, the Apple Black Friday sale will officially kick off on 25 November. And Cyber Monday will be hot on its heels on 28 November. That said, every year we are seeing retailers start their Black Friday sales early, with most offering deals of some kind as early as October. </p><p>In 2021, the best Apple Black Friday deals were definitely closer to the weekend itself, but many of the biggest discounts came up in the week before. It&apos;s never an exact science, so our advice would be to have a budget in mind, and when you see an Apple Black Friday deal that fits your bill, grab it before it&apos;s gone. </p>
<h2 id="apple-black-friday-what-happened-in-2021-2">Apple Black Friday: What happened in 2021?</h2>
<p><strong>Apple iPad:</strong> 2021 gave us some amazing Apple Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, with between £50-£100 off the brand new 2021 iPad line-up. The arrival of the new iPad Pros also meant a drop in price on many other models too, including the iPad Air and iPad mini.</p><p><strong>Apple MacBook:</strong> In 2020 we were really shocked to see Apple&apos;s M1 MacBook discounted by up to £107 by some retailers. The newly released laptop was the last thing we expected to see a deal on, but we weren&apos;t about to argue. Never did we think that would happen with the 2021 MacBook Pro Apple released just a month before the Black Friday sales. But we were wrong again. </p><p>2021 saw savings of up to $100 / £100 on both models, which might seem like a drop in the ocean compared to their overall price. But these devices are so new, and so sought-after, any money off them was worth taking advantage of. Who knows if Apple has anymore laptop releases up it&apos;s sleeve for next year, but here&apos;s hoping the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air Black Friday discounts continue. </p><p><strong>Apple AirPods:</strong> There were discounts to be found across the AirPods range in 2021, including $20 off AirPods Pro 3. In fact, if you&apos;re after some Apple headphones, Black Friday has proved one of the best times to get some. With more models now available, we expect to see even bigger and better AirPods deals in 2022. </p><p><strong>Apple Watch:</strong> With now seven versions of the Apple Watch, the most recent being released in Oct 2021, there was bound to be some savings to have on older models in the Black Friday sales. And they were quite impressive, to say the least. Even the Apple Watch Series 6 had some really decent discounts ($50 / £50) on particular models on Amazon, and even the new Series 7 had a couple of modest offers running for a while.</p><p>The Apple Watch Series 3 also had some amazing savings, with Very in the UK dropping the price to just £169. </p><p><strong>Apple iPhone: </strong>In terms of the iPhone, the country you&apos;re in and the carrier and contract you want to go with will determine the type of discount you can get. In 2021 we saw some deals on the newly released iPhone 13, which meant bigger and better deals on older models followed. </p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-the-best-apple-black-friday-deals-2">How to get the best Apple Black Friday deals</h2>
<p>If you&apos;re dreaming of getting a vast discount on that brand new 16-inch MacBook Pro, forget about it. Huge Apple Black Friday discounts never really happen; Apple kit tends to hold its value and serious savings aren&apos;t a thing that ever crop up, but if you&apos;re happy to pay a little less than full price for some new Apple gear, Black Friday&apos;s your best opportunity. And frankly even a small saving on a MacBook or iPad is worth grabbing.</p><p>The Apple Store isn&apos;t the place to get Apple Black Friday deals. Instead you should decide what hardware you&apos;re after and how much you want to pay for it, then check out some third-party retailers. Amazon, Currys and B&H Photo offered some of the biggest discounts in 2021, which included dropping the price of the all-new 2021 MacBook Pro by 5 per cent. </p><p>For the best deals without having to trawl through retailers, stick with us. We&apos;ll be providing direct links to all of the best Apple Black Friday deals for 2022 right here as they arrive. </p>
<h2 id="does-apple-have-black-friday-sales-2">Does Apple have Black Friday sales?</h2>
<p>In short: no. While Apple&apos;s happy to let third-party retailers discount its gear, you won&apos;t find any Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals at the Apple Store. Instead, for the last couple of years, at least, it rewards shoppers with gift cards that you can redeem against later purchases.</p><p>In 2021, you could get an Apple Black Friday gift card worth up to $200 / £160, but you had to buy a MacBook to get the top gift card. The upshot is if you&apos;re hoping to save actual money, you&apos;re generally better off looking at other retailers that sell Apple products rather than heading directly to Apple itself. We&apos;ll be updating this page with all the best Apple Black Friday deals from online retailers throughout November, so make sure you bookmark it and come back to check the sections above as new deals go live.</p>

For a machine that can cope with the demands of high-end 3D software, you&apos;re going to need a powerful CPU and GPU, plus plenty of fast memory and a lot of storage, and that can mean a lot of time combing through laptop specs to ensure that they&apos;re up to scratch in every regard.</p><p>That process has at least become a little easier of late, thanks to Nvidia introducing RTX Studio, a platform designed to showcase laptops that meet the right criteria for serious creative work, meaning that they deliver great performance for anyone working with 3D, animation, graphic design, video and photo editing software.</p><p>For a laptop to meet the RTX Studio performance bar, it needs to have, at the bare minimum, an Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, plus GeForce RTX 2060, Quadro RTX 3000 or Titan RTX GPU, with a display resolution of at least 1080P. So that RTX Studio badge is an easy sign to look for that a laptop&apos;s going to be up 3D work; and of course another option is to look for gaming laptops, as the demands of running AAA video games can be on a par with those of 3D content creation.</p><p>Both these options mean, however, that you&apos;re looking at a Windows laptop; if you prefer to create on Apple hardware, things are a little easier, as the MacBook Pro line packs plenty of power, as you&apos;ll see when you get to the first laptop in our list; you may also be able to pick up a bargain the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/best-black-friday-macbook-deals-2021">MacBook Black Friday</a> deals.</p><p>With that in mind, here is our round up of the best laptops for 3D modelling right now based on expert knowledge and personal reviews where we look at specs like display and storage.

<p>For 3D artists working on a mac there has never been a better time. The new 14-inch Macbook Pro 14-inch is a formidable machine, with lots of scope to spec suitable levels of RAM and storage for your projects. The M1 GPU is more than up to the task for rendered viewports, complex animations and high resolution texture sets. Whether your are running Maya, Cinema 4D, Houdini, Blender or any other mac-compatible software the 14-inch 2021 MacBook Pro should be high up on your shortlist.</p>

<p>The MSI GE76 Raider is a seriously heavyweight gaming laptop, with specs that make it an ideal choice for 3D modelling. It features a gorgeous 17-inch display that&apos;ll show off your creations to their very best advantage, and enough CPU and GPU power to deliver near-desktop performance in a reasonably thin form factor.</p><p>As a gaming laptop, it naturally has an RGB backlit keyboard, along with an RGB light bar along its front edge, a feature that you&apos;ll either love or turn off at the first opportunity. And when we described this laptop as a heavyweight, we meant it quite literally; depending on the configuration it can weigh up to 3kg, which makes it more of a machine for living on your desk than taking out and about with you.</p>

<p>The Razer Blade 15 Model feels squarely aimed at creatives. The design is stark, minimal and pretty good-looking, and the internal specs aren&apos;t to be scoffed at either. The touch-sensitive screen is another selling point, it&apos;s colour accurate with 100% DCI-P3 coverage. The range of configurations is a little confusing, so make sure you double check exactly what you&apos;re looking for before you buy. The Razer Blade is superior to the other models in that it was silent while we were doing our 3D tests, it was also 10 per cent faster than the laptops above. Overall, it looks great, and sounds great, but it is more expensive than other similar laptops with the same amount of storage.</p>

<p>The specs of this Intel Core i7-11800H with a GeFore RTX 3080 graphics card make it highly capable of high-end 3D modelling, as well as gaming. This laptop stands out because of the bright images its advanced 4K HDR OLED display show. There&apos;s also plenty of ports to be getting on with – it has three USB-3 and USB-C ports, as well as an SD card reader. Again, this laptop isn&apos;t the prettiest, and some will find it on the brash side, but overall, it&apos;s a decent option for 3D modelling, although it can get noisy. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Black Friday may be next weekend, but we&apos;re already seeing record-breaking deals on TVs that are just as good – if not better – than the deals we saw at last year&apos;s retail event. The latest TV deal to catch our eye is the absolutely massive saving of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-55-class-bravia-xr-a80j-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv/6455217.p?skuId=6455217" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$900 on the 55-inch Sony Bravia TV over at Best Buy</a>, down from the list value of $1,899.99 to just $999.99.</p><p>To put that in context, the same TV is currently on sale for $1,149 over at Amazon, so it&apos;s currently by far the best deal on the Bravia. However, the all-time best price we&apos;ve ever seen on this exact model was $998, earlier in the year, over at Amazon. </p><p>Now, we&apos;ve been clear that often the listing value that retailers give are the old retail price that&apos;s already been lowered with time, creating the illusion of greater savings than they are. In this case, all retailers are saying that the original listing price is $1,899.99, but we remember covering the release of this TV model, and distinctly remember the retail price being $1,699.99. If that&apos;s right, your saving here is reduced to $700, which is still a great deal (and there&apos;s every chance that we&apos;re wrong about that original price). </p><p>For all the latest best <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/deals/low-sony-a80j-price">Sony A80J price</a>, check out our dedicated page, or if you&apos;re a gamer, see our page on the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-tv-for-ps5">best TVs for PS5</a>. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Using one of the best monitor calibrator tools is a must for anyone working in visual design. Whether you create digital art, graphic design, photography or video, an accurate, uniform screen is one of the most important tools of the trade. Monitors and laptop screens vary dramatically, and even the same screen will fluctuate over time. Regular calibration is essential to make sure you&apos;re seeing your work the way it really looks. </p><p>Without this, it&apos;s easy to end up creating work that looks too dark or has overly saturated colours when you see it on another screen or printed out. This is true even of very good monitors and laptops – most need calibration when they come out of the box and will change over time. Ambient lighting also affects how your work looks on a screen, and some of the best monitor calibrators can take this into account.</p><p>Some monitors – usually expensive screens designed for professional – come with their own calibrators. For all others, you&apos;ll want one of the best monitor calibrator tools, which can be bought online individually or in bundles with other tools. These are physical devices that you place on your screen to check its brightness, contrast and colour coverage and accuracy. Some downloadable tools claim to be able to calibrate these things, but they can&apos;t actually &apos;see&apos; your screen like the best monitor calibrators can.</p><p>You can learn more about the importance of monitor calibration at the bottom of this guide. As for which tools to use, there are really two main brands: Datacolor&apos;s Spyder X range and Calibrite&apos;s ColorChecker (Wacom has a calibrator for its own drawing tablets too). Both Datacolor and Calibrite offer several models: a standard option, a more pro model with extra features and finally studio packages that can also calibrate printers. They also have bundles that include other tools, often mainly geared towards photography.</p><p>We&apos;ve selected the best monitor calibrator tools at different price points based on our own reviewers&apos; experiences using them, their specs, the types of screens they can calibrate and useful extra features like ambient light detection and multi-screen calibration. As well as using these tools to calibrate their own monitors, our reviewers also regularly use them to test displays when we write our monitor reviews (read more about <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/how-we-test">how we test and review</a>).</p><p>Of course, even the best monitor calibrators can&apos;t perform magic. You&apos;ll need to start with a monitor that provides good colour coverage and accuracy if you&apos;re creating visuals. For help in that aspect, see our guides to the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-monitors-for-photo-editing">best monitors for photo editing</a> and the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-monitor">best 4K monitors</a>.

<p>Datacolor is one of the best-known brands when it comes to monitor calibration, and it&apos;s followed up its Spyder5 range of monitor calibrators with SpyderX, which we&apos;ve found to improve on nearly every aspect of the previous models. SpyderX monitor calibrators use a new lens-based sensor system that makes calibration faster while also increasing accuracy so you can be even more confident in your screen&apos;s colour accuracy. If you calibrate your monitors regularly (and we recommend you do), the faster calibration can save you quite a bit of time in the long run.</p><p>The SpyderX Pro is now the cheapest option in the Datacolor calibration range (the former Spyder5 range had a budget "Express" model). That said, it&apos;s still one of the best monitor calibrators we&apos;ve tried for overall value, offering useful advanced features like multi-monitor support. It detects light conditions to ensure a monitor looks its best wherever you&apos;re working. We find Datacolor&apos;s software, which comes with the device, is easy to use, allowing us to get started calibrating immediately. The more expensive SpyderX Elite (see number 5) offers some extra features, but for most people, this standard option will be all they need for reliable monitor calibration.</p>

<p>Previously named X-Rite i1 Display Pro, the brilliant Calibrite ColorChecker Display Pro is a monitor calibrator that offers a whole lot of features and options, although you do pay for them. The naming gets a bit confusing here because Datacolor&apos;s SpyderX Pro (above) is its standard calibrator tool, whereas Calibrite reserves the "Pro" tag for this, the second model up in its range, above the cheaper ColorChecker Display but below the slightly more expensive ColorChecker Display Plus.</p><p>This monitor calibrator allows you to use your profile across multiple displays (either on the same machine or network) as well as assess the ambient light in your workspace to set your monitor up for best results. A technology called Flare Correct will measure and adjust your display profile for reduced contrast ratios caused by glare on your screen. Video colour standards are also incorporated, so video editors can set up their display for best results, too.</p><p>If you think the Calibrite Color Checker Display Pro is a little too expensive for your needs, take a look at the standard ColorChecker Display at number 4 in our selection of the best monitor calibrator tools. Or if you need to measure super-bright displays over 1000 nits, you&apos;ll want to opt for the still more expensive Display Plus at number 5. All three of these products were previously part of the X-Rite i1 range, which has been rebranded as Calibrite ColorChecker but is produced by the reliable X-Rite.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re a professional who has the budget, and space, for the SpyderX Studio, then this is one of the best purchases you can make. It comes with the SpyderX Elite monitor colorimeter (see number six below), as well as a SpyderPrint spectrocolorimeter for checking prints and the SpyderCube, which can be used to calibrate Raw images.</p><p>It&apos;s essentially an all-in-one kit that gives professional photographers and designers everything they need to ensure every aspect of their work is properly calibrated. This means it&apos;s pricey, and as there&apos;s a lot of gear, you&apos;ll need to make sure you have enough room for it in your office or studio. It will probably also all be a bit overwhelming for beginners. However, by offering a collection of some of the best calibration and color-assessing tools on the market all together, it&apos;s a fantastic choice for people who want to upgrade their entire setup with a single purchase.</p>

<p>Sitting a couple of notches below the more expensive Calibrite ColorChecker Display Pro in our pick of the best monitor calibrator tools is the standard model in the range, the Calibrite ColorChecker Display (formerly X-Rite i1Display). It offers most of the same features as the more expensive model, with the key difference being the lack of ambient light monitoring. We found this to be a definite drawback for getting things perfect in an office environment with artificial lighting or glare. Also, the measurement speed also isn&apos;t as high as the Pro, although it&apos;s not like it takes a lot of time if you&apos;re only calibrating the one monitor. If you&apos;re looking to spend less, this will still calibrate your display very well without the extra expense of the Pro or Pro Plus (see below).</p>

<p>At the top of the Calibrite ColorChecker range is Calibrite ColorChecker Display Plus. We only place it lower on our list because of the price, since it&apos;s more than what many people will need. However, while it&apos;s more expensive, this is the calibrator to go for if you need to deal with super-bright displays. Calibrite&apos;s other calibrators handle up to 1,000 nits while this will manage up to 2,000 nits. It also offers slightly better measurement for darker tones.</p><p>As such, it&apos;s the best calibrator for HDR displays on this list, as well as other super-bright monitors that we&apos;re now seeing more of on the market. It also supports Black Current Subtraction to minimise noise. And, as with the company&apos;s other calibrators we&apos;ve featured you can profile up to four separate displays.</p>

<p>Datacolor also has an enhanced model of its SpyderX calibrator that we put at number one in our list. The Spyder X Pro will cover most people&apos;s needs but we found this SpyderX Elite colorimeter does offer some extra features that will be useful for some. It looks identical to its cheaper sibling, but this model can calibrate your monitor not only to conform to a typical 2.2 gamma and 6500 K white point, but also to colour space standards like sRGB, Adobe RGB, NTSC and Rec 709. </p><p>It uses the same hardware as the Pro and takes around the same length of time (about two minutes) to calibrate a screen, so this is really a recommendation only for those that specifically want to calibrate their monitor for video colour spaces or to have complete control over every part of the calibration process.</p>

<p>This bundle is an interesting buy for photographers and photo editors. As well as the SpyderX Elite monitor calibrator above, you also get other tools bundled in. You get the Spyder LensCal to your camera lens autofocus and the Spyder Cube to define white and black values and get accurate RAW settings for editing. You also get Spyder Checkr, which uses HSL-Presets to control colour consistency across cameras. These tools may not be of interest to anyone other than photographers – and many photographers may already have some of the tools, but it&apos;s a good bundle for anyone who needs a full calibration kit.</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t a general-purpose display calibrator unlike all the others here. Instead it&apos;s designed specifically for use with Wacom&apos;s own Cintiq pen displays (and not all of them, so be sure to check if yours is compatible). If you do use a compatible Wacom Cintiq tablet, then the Wacom Colour Manager is the best monitor calibrator we can recommend to ensure the accuracy of your screen. It&apos;s fairly expensive – comparable to the Calibrite Display Pro at number 2 above, but it&apos;s a specialist tool for a very particular task.</p>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is a monitor calibrator tool?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Monitor calibration involves measuring and adjusting the colours on your computer monitor to meet a set standard. The best monitor calibrator tools include two components to do that: hardware and software. The hardware takes the form of a sprectocolorimiter or colorimeter, which measures your monitor and records colour values, brightness and contrast, as well as other variables. The software takes that data and builds a colour profile for your monitor.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What's the purpose of a monitor calibrator tool?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The monitor you use and the setting where you locate it can have a big impact on how your work looks. Every screen displays images differently, so the colours you see on a phone screen, your monitor or a client's monitor will vary. That's because the internal workings of every screen are different (before you factor in the screen settings and ambient light conditions). </p>
<p>This is a big deal for anyone who works in visual arts and design. Most computer screens give a vibrant, dynamic picture, but this isn’t always the best for editing your photos, for example. If you edit images on a monitor that hasn’t been calibrated, you may end up exporting pictures that look oversaturated, muted or have an obvious colour cast when you see them on another screen or on a printed support.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter which colour space you select on your camera or how you adjust Photoshop’s settings – if the screen has a warm cast or a cool blue cast and isn’t showing you an accurate picture, then any edits you make may be subtly or substantially out. </p>
<p>So which version represents the “true” colour? And will printed materials look like they do on your screen? This is where the best monitor calibrators come in. Technically known as colorimeters, they look at your screen and detect any discrepancies, taking account of how your display actually looks in your office space, whether that's at home, in a co-working space or from a dedicated workspace. </p>
<p>They can then program your computer then programmed to compensate for the colour inaccuracy of your monitor. Calibrating your monitor also means looking after yourself because it helps reduce eye strain during intensive work sessions.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How do I choose the best monitor calibrator for me?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>How much you need to spend on a monitor calibrator depends to an extent on what you need it to calibrate and what you use your screen for, but there are several features to consider</p>
<p><strong>Screen types: </strong>Monitors use different types of technology, and that can affect their colours, so you want a calibration tool that can account for things like LED backlighting. Most of the tools we've included in our guide to the best monitor calibrators can be used on any monitor or laptop, and also on projectors, but always double-check the tool you're going to buy. </p>
<p>If you print your work, you can also calibrate your printer to ensure its colours are also the best they can be. For that, you’ll need a calibrator designed for printer proﬁling, such as the Datacolor SpyderX Studio at number 3 or Calibrite ColorChecker Display Plus at number 5 in our list above.</p>
<p><strong>Ambient light detection</strong>: look for this feature for customised calibration that adapts to compensate for the surrounding ambient light in your room or office.</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong>: how fast your monitor calibration tool works might not seem so important, but if you calibrate your monitor as often as your should, then you'll be grateful for a fast device. Most options will actually remind you when it's time for your to calibrate your screen again.</p>
<p><strong>Other features</strong>:<strong> </strong>More advanced features to look out for on monitor calibrators are conformity with the best-known colour standards and screen calibration, which ensures you see the same colours across a multi-monitor setup.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How often should I calibrate my monitor?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>All monitors change in colour, contrast, and brightness as they age. Because of this, the majority of the best calibration software suggests you calibrate your monitor (or monitors) every 2-6 weeks. With the monitor calibrators we've listed above, the process only takes around two minutes per monitor.</p>
<p> LCD monitors don’t age or change as quickly as older CRT technology, but you still want to rest assured that colours on your screen are accurate so even an LCD should be calibrated every six months at the very least. For a detailed look at how monitor calibration tools work, see our article on <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/advice/how-to-calibrate-your-monitor">how to calibrate your monitor</a>.</p></article></section>

While a DSLR or even your phone can provide you with all the crystal-clear shots you need, with a disposable camera the limitations – the fixed lens, limited perspective and a finite number of shots before you run out of film – force you to stop and think before you point and shoot.</p><p>That said, they&apos;re also a lot of fun. Disposable – or single-use – cameras are perfect for getting a lo-fi analogue look that Instagram filters can never really replicate; you can do just as well in that regard by checking out the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-instant-cameras">best instant cameras</a>.</p><p>And while the notion of a disposable camera sounds more than a little irresponsible from an environmental point of view, they&apos;re not as bad as you might think. You&apos;ll find that many of the cameras in this list act just like disposable cameras, but they&apos;re actually reusable and allow you to change the film and batteries when you need to. Top analogue revivalists Lomography have a great way of describing their kit; not single-use cameras, but simple-use cameras. Nice.</p><p>Even if the concept of a reusable disposable camera is unfortunately little more than fiction, these cameras are generally very recyclable. Many manufacturers invite you to send your camera back so it can be refilled or resold; just don&apos;t toss it in the trash.</p><p>We&apos;ve put together a selection of the best disposable cameras available right now. Honestly, they all look pretty similar from the outside, but inside you&apos;ll find a variety of film stocks that can result in markedly different shots. And once you&apos;ve shot your perfect analogue images, you may well want to digitise them; in which case, see our guide to the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-photo-scanners">best photo scanners</a>. But if on the whole you&apos;d rather stick to digital photography, check our guides to the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-camera">best cameras</a> and the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-cameras-for-beginners">best cameras for beginners</a>. </p>

<p>While Ilford specialises in black and white film, this retro colour camera gives its fans a blast from the past – and is one of the most fun disposable cameras you can use. It&apos;s loaded with Ilfocolor film, which gives images a stylish, washed-out look that instantly transports you back to the 1960s. That pop of colour is something else.</p><p>With a fixed-focus lens and a set shutter speed, the camera only requires you to point and shoot (this will be a common theme as we go down the list). There is an amount of control you can exercise though – you can activate and deactivate the flash with a touch, meaning it doesn&apos;t blast out a scene when you don&apos;t need it. </p>

<p>We mentioned the Ilford “Simple Use” cameras at the start of this guide, but the fact is that they&apos;re more than a clever name. While they&apos;re simple to operate, they come with fun extra features like colour gels that can be placed over the flash to give an image a stylised tint of colour.</p><p>A few options are available, but we&apos;ve picked the camera that&apos;s packing Lomochrome Metropolis. A more subtle, muted film than some of Lomography&apos;s wildly coloured emulsions, it&apos;s perfect for exploring the city. But hey, if you don&apos;t like it, finish the roll and load the camera with something else! We&apos;d recommend sticking with ISO 400 though – the camera won&apos;t know if you load something that requires a different exposure time. </p>

<p>When you think back to the look and feel of disposable cameras from back in the day, you’re basically thinking of the Fujifilm QuickSnap Flash 400. With its fixed-focus lens, its single-button operation and its powerful built-in flash, this is an archetypal disposable film camera. Loaded with ISO 400 Fuji Superia colour film, it’ll do well in the majority of lighting conditions, probably only struggling in the black of night. You get 27 exposures, and it’s so simple anyone can use it. There are some cameras on this list with more exciting features or special uses, but if you’re just looking for a straightforward, good-quality disposable camera, this is it. </p>

<p>This stylish rechargeable camera from Harman functions like a disposable camera, but like many of its contemporaries, is completely reusable. Its built-in flash is powered with AAA batteries, and in the box, you get two rolls of Kentmere, a budget black and white film with a usefully high ISO of 400 for use in all different lighting conditions.</p><p>The fast 1/120sec shutter combines with an f/10 lens to make for a solid, all-purpose photography setup. It&apos;s a basic setup, but that&apos;s just what you want from a disposable-style camera. Point that 31mm lens at pretty much anything and it&apos;ll probably come out in focus – as long as you&apos;re more than 1m away. </p>

<p>Disposable cameras are great for holidays, as they’re fun for anyone to use and make it easy to create physical images of your adventures. The AgfaPhoto LeBox Ocean 400 has one advantage over other disposable cameras when it comes to holiday use – it’s waterproof and sandproof, making it a great choice for beach getaways. </p><p>It can be submerged down to depths of 3m, meaning it’s ideal for leisurely dips in the sea, and its included yellow wrist strap means you can easily keep it secure and not worry about dropping it. The controls are also big and visible, meaning they’re kid-friendly if you’ve got little ones on your holiday. But really this is one of the best disposable cameras for all ages. </p>

<p>In 2021, Kodak unveiled its Tri-X 400 Single Use Camera, a disposable camera loaded with B&W film dating all the way back to 1954, making it a shoo-in as the best disposable camera for a vintage look. Long beloved by professional photographers of the era for its dramatic, high-contrast look and its forgiving exposure latitude, Tri-X built up a reputation as a film for all situations. Its striking look may not be what you want for, say, a family barbecue, but for exciting photography with fantastic tonality, it’s a great choice. This flexible format works in lots of lighting conditions – if you’ve fired off a lot of shots in dark conditions, you may be able to ask your developer to “push” the film by one or two stops to retain detail. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kq2DwGPa7NrMwcw7qByPeT" name="6 ilford xp2.jpg" alt="Ilford Single Use Camera XP2 on white background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kq2DwGPa7NrMwcw7qByPeT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ilford)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Normally, black and white film has to be developed using a different process to colour film, and many photo labs will often charge more for it (and you can expect it to take longer). Ilford’s XP2 super film is a different breed though; it can be developed using the C41 process normally reserved for colour film. This can really save you a headache once you’re done shooting and just want to find a high street lab that can handle your film with a fast turnaround time. Also, XP2 looks great – it’s a high-contrast B&W film with a stylish grain that’s ideal for getting shots with a little drama and flair.</p>

<p>Ilford HP5 Plus 400, to give it the full title, is perhaps the standard B&W film stock. It’s the one that photographers reach for time and again when they want an all-purpose film that’ll handle most situations; it’s arguably not as exciting as XP2 or Tri-X, but it’s great for getting clear and sharp images that are full of detail. You do have to get it processed with proper B&W processing, which can be more time-consuming and expensive, but the images that come back are all but guaranteed to look a cut above what you might expect from a disposable camera. </p>

<p>The Kodak Funsaver 35mm Single Use Camera uses Kodak’s ISO 800 film, as opposed to the ISO 400 in most other disposable cameras. This means that it’s more sensitive to light, and thus more usable in low-light conditions, the trade-off being that higher sensitivity film has more grain. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing – as these days, with pristine digital sensors available all over, film grain has become something of a sought-after look – but it’s something to be aware of. Also, be aware that this is a pretty cheap disposable camera and it feels it, with a flimsy plastic construction sleeved in paper. Still, were you buying a disposable camera for its build quality? Of course not!</p>

<p>If you don’t need the waterproofing of the AgfaPhoto LeBox Ocean, then this is essentially the vanilla version, which can be picked up for a cheaper price. It shoots colour film (which may surprise some analogue aficionados, as AgfaPhoto only really sells black and white films these days) and can produce 27 exposures that&apos;ll look solid in all sorts of conditions. The built-in flash is handy, with a 4m effective range – and as with many disposables, you’d likely be best off leaving it on pretty much all the time. It’s not as exciting a film stock as Kodak Tri-X, Lomochrome Metropolis or Ilford’s Retrocolor, but it gets the job done.</p><p><strong>Read more: </strong></p>

<p>A lot of YouTubers highly rate the Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III, and it&apos;s easy to see why. It&apos;s not the most exceptional camera in any category really, but a superb jack-of-all-trades, doing everything that YouTubers need it to do, all in a tiny body that you can basically take anywhere.</p><p>This little camera is capable of 4K UHD video at 30p (although there is a recording time limit of 10 minutes), and HD video is available at up to 120fps, allowing you to create slow-motion effects. The Mark III version adds a 3.5mm mic jack, which makes a difference in terms of audio quality. The 24-100mm f/1.8-2.8 lens is fixed and can&apos;t be changed, however, this zoom range is fine for most YouTube use, and the maximum aperture of f/1.8 is generous enough to make the G7X Mark III pretty nifty in low light. </p><p>Another real plus for YouTubers are concerned is that the camera can livestream, broadcasting footage with a clean HDMI out. There are cameras out there with more advanced video specs, but the majority of content creators won&apos;t need them.

<p>Sony had for a while been hurting for a dedicated mid-range vlogging camera. While the ZV-1 compact was nice, what vloggers and YouTubers were really after was a mirrorless camera that would allow them to change lenses and generally be more flexible. Step forward, the Sony ZV-E10, an APS-C mirrorless camera absolutely loaded with video features.</p><p>The 4K UHD detail and quality is excellent, while Full HD can be stepped up to 120p for slow-motion footage. Also, while buying an external microphone is always better, if you&apos;re working on a tight budget, the built-in mics on the ZV-E10 do a thoroughly credible job, thanks in part to the larger grille on top that allows for higher-fidelity sound capture. </p><p>It&apos;s not a perfect camera – there&apos;s a marked rolling shutter effect that occurs when you try to pan in 4K, and as is so often the case with Sony, the menus can be confusing. These are small points, however, and the core experience of the Sony ZV-E10 truly is very solid. </p>

<p>Every YouTuber is going to be at a different skill level, with some boasting much more advanced video knowledge than others. If you&apos;re someone who likes to get under the bonnet of a camera and tinker with your video footage until it&apos;s precisely perfect, then the Panasonic Lumix GH6 is for you. This is one of the best consumer video cameras ever made.</p><p>The beating heart of the camera is its new 25MP stacked sensor, which enables much faster readout speeds, and means that it puts many more video options at the user&apos;s disposal. It can shoot using basically every conceivable codec a filmmaker or YouTuber could want, and it can go up to 5.7K resolution at 30fps in Apple ProRes format.</p><p>If this doesn&apos;t mean much to you, then the Lumix GH6 is probably more camera than you need, and you can safely go for a cheaper option. However, for the geeks among us, it&apos;s an absolutely superb choice. A CFexpress Type B card slot allows you to insert one of the fastest and <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-memory-cards">best memory cards</a> to take advantage of the high-quality formats.</p>

<p>The Sony ZV-1 has a lot of features that make it a great camera for YouTube. The sensor and lens are similar to the Sony RX100, but the body, the controls, the audio, and the rear screen are all optimised brilliantly for vlogging. You get a vari-angle rear screen for creative shooting and of course, front-facing footage, a clip-on windshield for recording clear audio outdoors, and brilliantly fast AF – all in a compact size that&apos;s easy to slip into a pocket. </p><p>The camera doesn&apos;t have a built-in viewfinder, flash, or even a mode dial, but there is a big Record button and a big built-in mic – just what you need for recording YouTube content on the go. It&apos;s slightly more expensive than the Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II at the top of our list (which does have a flash) but there&apos;s really not much in it. </p>

<p>Nikon now has three APS-C cameras in its Z mirrorless range, and the Z30 is unabashedly vlogger-focused. It&apos;s got no viewfinder, just a vari-angle screen, and is capable of shooting uncropped 4K UHD video. Tidy and compact, the Z30 is light enough to carry pretty much anywhere, and we love its chunky, protruding handgrip that makes one-handed shooting a breeze.</p><p>The Z cameras are still in relatively early days, especially those with smaller APS-C sensors. This means that there aren&apos;t as many lenses widely available to specifically fit these cameras – not nearly as many as there are for the Z30&apos;s nearest obvious rival, the Sony ZV-E10, which benefits from the long history of Sony E-mount. </p><p>Still, this is a cleverly designed camera with a lot going for it, like in-camera stabilisation for video, and a decent built-in mic with wind-noise reduction.  </p>

<p>Although this line of Sony cameras has grown massively as of late, the original Sony A6000 is still one of the most popular models. Newer YouTubers who are yet to bring in enough revenue to pay for fancy kit will rejoice at how affordable the A6000 is now. But it should be noted that there&apos;s a limit of Full HD quality video (no 4K, unfortunately) so bear that in mind if it&apos;s a deal-breaker. Otherwise, the camera has rock-solid foundations in the shape of a large 24MP APS-C sensor and a capable image processor with a 179-point autofocus system.</p><p>Choose to pair the camera with one of Sony&apos;s E-mount lenses for enhanced shooting flexibility and great image quality. This camera serves as a reminder that you don’t always need the newest, flashiest device to produce quality video for YouTube. Sometimes there’s better value in older models.</p>

<p>If you&apos;ve got budget to spare, and are looking at the high-end of camera tech, then we&apos;d recommend considering the Canon EOS R5. It&apos;s a hybrid camera designed for both stills and video shooters, but its video features are some of the best in class. The headline spec is 8K at 30p, which is more than you need for YouTube, but this also gives you the option to crop in and get excellent 4K footage, or shoot in 4K natively and enjoy some of the best-looking video you can get. You can even dial 4K up to a frame rate of 120fps if you want.</p><p>Canon&apos;s Dual Pixel CMOS II autofocus is one of the best systems in the business, and it works fantastically for video as well as stills. Video also benefits from in-body image stabilisation, making it a simpler task to capture smooth footage while using the camera hand-held. The burgeoning selection of RF lenses is also fantastic, with some of the sharpest optics around, and if you already have EF DSLR lenses, then the EF-to-RF adapter lets you use them on the R5 with full functionality.</p><p>It&apos;s not a perfect camera – it gained something of a reputation on release for its recording limits in high resolutions due to an overheating issue. It&apos;s not a crippling issue, just something to be aware of; as we made plain in our full review, this is still one of the most advanced and <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-camera">best cameras</a> you can buy right now, full stop, and it&apos;s one of the most versatile buys that YouTubers can make.</p>

<p>Throw it in a lake, hurl it off a mountain, or bounce it along on a mountain bike, if you need extreme durability, then GoPro is the brand for you.

It retains the 10&apos;s useful front screen to make selfie vlogging easier and it has updated its class-leading HyperSmooth 4.0 with the, wait for it, HyperSmooth 5.0 image stabilisation. It can capture smooth, steady footage when being thrown around in extreme conditions. </p><p>The Hero10 Black now captures even more detail thanks to the 5.3K video resolution (91% more than 4K) which it records at an incredible 60FPS. There&apos;s also a new video feature of 4K at 120FPS for those who like to capture footage for slow motion, and the horizon lock feature makes every jump, flight or wild descent look even more impressive. Extreme shooters that need a camera that can keep up with them should opt for the Hero11 Black if they want smooth video and reliable results. </p>

<p>Blackmagic has a reputation among filmmakers and camera operators alike as excellent plug-and-film devices. They produce cameras capable of capturing terrific footage as conveniently as possible. The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K has a large Super 35 sensor and can shoot 6K Raw footage at 60fps, making it a great option for producing high-resolution YouTube videos that stand out from the crowd – something that&apos;s very important on the world&apos;s biggest video sharing platform.</p><p>Thanks to the Canon EF mount built into the BPCC 6K, users can expect to use any number of the EF line-up of Canon lenses which expands affordability and flexibility when it comes to choosing glass. Anyone considering YouTube full-time may want to invest in this camera because not only does it pack pro-level features into a portable body while being lighter on the wallet than most cinema cameras as well.

<p>Canon built on the EOS 70D&apos;s popularity among YouTubers by producing this latest option, the 90D. Aimed squarely at the video market, it captures detailed uncropped 4K UHD video and can even shoot slow motion 120fps when the resolution is dropped to Full HD. It even captures 32.5MP stills for multimedia video content, should you need it. Canon also revamped the I/O by installing external microphone and headphone connections to help with audio monitoring and recording.</p><p>The EOS 90D is chunkier and heavier than other cameras on this list because it draws on its DSLR heritage. But a big advantage to that is its weather-sealing, meaning you can keep shooting even if it rains or snows. We found it to be satisfying to handle, too, with a large, bright optical viewfinder. At this price, it’s an absolute steal for video producers who don&apos;t mind something slightly bulkier.</p>

<p>The DJI Action 2 is an incredibly compact modular action camera with premium styling. It can&apos;t beat the video quality or usefulness of its main competitor the GoPro Hero 10 Black (see above) but it&apos;s a fantastic choice for YouTubers who value style and compact portability.</p><p>When we reviewed it, we were impressed with the blasted metal finish, although it did strike us as more prone to dents than the GoPro. But we were most impressed with the neat magnetic, modular accessories, which can add extra battery life, Micro SD card support and a USB-C port depending on which package you go for. You can add a selfie screen, a macro lens and more. The downside is that when modules are added, the device is no longer waterproof without additional housing. But the biggest limit for YouTubers will be its overheating, which means you can only record the highest quality 4K footage for bursts of up to around 4 minutes.</p><p>See our full <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/dji-action-2">DJI Action 2 review</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The Panasonic Lumix S series has wowed camera people and tech geeks alike since its arrival a few years ago, with the Lumix S1H being added to the list of cameras approved by Netflix for use shooting its content. The Lumix S5, a more recent model, basically inherits most of the S1H&apos;s functionality and crams it into a much more reasonably priced body, which makes it a winner in our book. </p><p>Able to capture 10-bit DCI and UHD 4K full-frame video at up to 30p with 10-bit 4:2:2 color, the Panasonic Lumix S5 is seriously impressive for pretty much any user. The dual gain sensor delivers impressive dynamic range at low ISO settings, and the variable frame rate function that lets you switch from high frame rates to low ones to dramatically slow down and speed up your footage.</p><p>While shooting can be unlimited on the Lumix S5, some modes do incur a 30-minute limit. It lacks a few of the S1H&apos;s top-of-the-line features, like 6K video, but honestly on YouTube you almost certainly do not need them. This is a superb YouTuber&apos;s camera, with a rich full-frame sensor that produces astonishing detail. </p>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How should I choose the best camera for YouTube?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The best camera for YouTube for you will depend on what type of video you're looking to share on your channel. If you want good quality video, then you'll want the ability to record in Full HD (1080p). That said, many cameras now offer 4K, which YouTube now supports (see below).</p>
<p>You also want a camera that can adapt to different lighting settings, and check the camera's video length limit if you're planning to record long videos (see below for more on that).</p>
<p>Video isn't the only thing to consider. There's also sound. The best cameras for YouTube also offer excellent sound recording via a built-in microphone with noise-cancelling capabilities – although you may still want to consider mics depending on the type of video you're producing.</p>
<p>You also need to consider portability because some cameras may prove to be too big and heavy if you're often filming on the move. In our selection of the best cameras for YouTube, we've included some good compact options that are convenient for carrying in a bag.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Do more expensive cameras capture better footage for Youtube?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Not necessarily. Of course, higher end models usually come equipped with higher resolutions, better dynamic range and less image noise. But the best camera for the job is the one that suits your shooting style. A vlogger that loves to edit videos before uploading and requires highly detailed stills photographs of subjects may mean a lean towards dedicated mirrorless cameras.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Do I need 4K video for YouTube?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>While you don't need 4K to make a video for YouTube, it certainly does no harm. As video resolution and internet speeds improve we're able to stream higher resolution video, sharing the best quality footage with our audiences. 8K video footage is now seeping through the camera market and 4K is slowly becoming what Full HD was when 4K was introduced not so long ago. </p>
<p>If you spot a camera with 'just HD' video capability we now ask 'why?' - usually because manufacturers are trying to make things smaller, lighter, or cheaper. Even if your end product will be presented in 1080p, 4K still delivers a higher quality downsampled image.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What does video length limit mean?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Video length limits are camera-imposed limits on recording length for video. E.g. a 10 minute video length limits mean that after 10 minutes the camera will stop recording video. You can start recording again after this time, but you won't be able to record any longer footage. If you need to keep recording for as long as possible, in one long take, be sure to look for recording length restrictions when shopping for a new camera for YouTube.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What kind of camera do YouTubers use?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>There's no one answer here, as all different types of camera are popular on YouTube. Some like compacts such as the Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III, while others prefer mirrorless cameras or even DSLRs. And of course, some YouTubers get by using their smartphones. It's all about figuring out what works best for you. </p></article></section>

<p>If you&apos;re running a fully fledged business, you need a professional logo, and even the best free logo designer software really isn&apos;t able to deliver that.

<p>Adobe Illustrator remains the industry standard tool for vector editing. It&apos;s the most used software among freelancers and design agencies for everything from illustration to poster design, icons, and, of course, designing logos. It&apos;s a powerful, feature-rich piece software package that works smoothly and efficiently with other Adobe apps, such as Photoshop and InDesign. You can access assets such as Adobe fonts and Adobe Stock within its interface too. </p><p>If you’re completely new to design software, Illustrator does involve quite a steep learning curve, although our selection of the best <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/digital-art/illustrator-tutorials-1232697">Adobe Illustrator tutorials</a> and our guide to <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/branding/design-killer-logo-illustrator-91412990">designing a killer logo in Illustrator</a> can help there. Also, note that you can&apos;t buy Illustrator as a one-off purchase, but only as a subscription, which can be quite expensive (although an <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/adobe-deals">Adobe Creative Cloud discount</a> can help keep the price down). </p><p>The upside of the subscription model is that Adobe is constantly updating the software, and as a subscriber, you always have access to the newest features. The latest version, launched in late 2021, makes it easy to work with linked Photoshop Creative Cloud files in Illustrator and adds a new dedicated 3D and materials panel. The fact that Illustrator&apos;s now available for iPad also sweetens the deal, and <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/illustrator-on-the-ipad-launched">Illustrator for iPad</a> is one of the best tools there are for logo design on an iPad.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, Adobe Illustrator involves an often rather costly monthly subscription. If your budget is tight, then Illustrator&apos;s main rival, Affinity Designer, is a good alternative for a surprisingly affordable one-off price. This vector editor boasts advanced features that are comparable with Illustrator, and it&apos;s increasingly used in the design industry. </p><p>Admittedly, it still lacks some of Illustrator&apos;s features and tools, but it also offers some improvements, such as million-plus Zoom, and the fact that the iPad version is exactly the same as the desktop one. Affinity Designer runs super-fast on the latest hardware, and the most recent update (V1.10) in August, has made it faster still.

In contrast, Canva Logo Maker makes it very easy to create a logo using professionally designed templates and a simple drag-and-drop interface right in your browser. It&apos;s easy to use, and handy pop-up instructions help you along the way.</p><p>Add your brand name to the template, and start tweaking the elements until you’ve crafted a design you’re happy with. Once you’re done, you can download and share your finished logo as a PNG file. It&apos;s all free if you use your own images and graphics, while the graphic elements in the library start at $1 each. </p>

<p>If you have no design skills at all, your best option is Tailor Brands Logo Maker. It&apos;s the best logo designer software for non-designers, and that&apos;s because it basically does all of the designing for you. You type in the wording you want in your logo, then you&apos;re presented with a series of binary font options, and asked which you like better (you can say if you dislike both). It only takes a minute or two and once you’re done, the tool uses some clever AI to conjure up a selection of potential logo designs based on your choices. </p><p>The designs proffered can be icon-based, initial-based or name-based. If you like one of them as it is, you can download it straight away as an SVG or EPS file. If you "sort of" like it, you can start to customise details such as the text, typeface and colours etc, with the simple in-browser tools, making all the tweaks you want until you’re happy. </p><p>Tailor Brands Logo Maker is free to try, but you’ll have to subscribe for access to the high-resolution logo files. Subscribing will also give you access to a logo resize tool, your logo in different social media sizes, plus a graphic design tool, stock photos and icons, and an AI-driven website builder, which is quite a package. All in all, we found the platform very easy to use when we reviewed it, but we found that logos could be generic, with few options for customisation. See our hands-on <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/canva">Tailor Brands review</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Looka is another logo designer tool that does all the designing for you. Just input your preferences and Looka will use its AI to mock up a corresponding design, which you can adjust later – in fact, you even modify it after you pay to download it. </p><p>You get a range of customisation options (though more would certainly be welcome.  You also have the ability to change colours, fonts, layouts, and symbols. There are over 300 templates to choose from and it&apos;s all very easy to use. Designing a logo is free; the sting is that you&apos;ll need to pay to download. There&apos;s a range of pricing options, including a &apos;logo-only&apos; fee plus subscription options, and you can download your logo as a PNG image or vector file. If you need more design options, you can also use Looka&apos;s Brand Kit tools to make social media assets, business cards, websites, posters and flyers.</p>

<p>Designhill Logo Maker is another option that&apos;s powered by AI. Working in a very similar way to Tailor Brands Logo Maker (number 4 on our list), it invites you to enter your details and pick the colours and designs that you like the look of. You&apos;re then shown a number of bespoke designs to choose from and customise if desired. </p><p>Generating a logo is quick, easy and free, so if you&apos;re a non-designer it&apos;s definitely worth a look. Again, you pay when it comes to downloading your completed designs, and that can be expensive. That said, you may find it&apos;s worth it if the software comes up with a logo design that you truly love, and it will certainly be cheaper than hiring a designer for a professional job.</p>

<p>ICONA Logo Maker is a paid-for app for iPhone and iPad that makes a very poor first impression due to its misspelled tagline "Porfessional Logo Studio" on the App Store, which inexplicably in over 4 years ICONA still hasn&apos;t corrected. Apart from that, though, this logo designer is actually quite good. With more than a million customisable designs, 350K+ image backgrounds and custom hues ranging from solid colours to gradients, there’s a lot of flexibility, so you&apos;re less likely to create a generic logo that looks the same as everyone else&apos;s.</p>

<p>Despite the &apos;Pro&apos; in the title (yes, so many products throw in a &apos;pro&apos; that it&apos;s started to become meaningless), Logo Design Studio Pro isn&apos;t really for professionals at all. It&apos;s closer to the Canva Logo Maker (number 3 on our list), with a simple interface that makes it easy for novice designers to make a basic logo. This option uses a subscription model for payment, but that allows you to design as many logos as you like. There are plenty of assets to help you, including thousands of templates and graphics, and hundreds of commercially licensed fonts. </p><p>If you&apos;re only looking to create one logo, using this app doesn&apos;t make much sense, and you might be better off with one of the best free logo designers below. But if you want to create several, or you want to start to explore logo design with the idea of entering the industry, it might be of interest.</p>
<h2 id="the-best-free-logo-designer-software-2">The best free logo designer software</h2>
<p>Looking for the best free logo designer software? Well here goes. Note that many apps will provide you with logo tools that appear to be free but then demand you cough up to if you want to download the logo you&apos;ve generated. To save you wasted time, we&apos;ve included that type of software above in the paid-for section. Below you&apos;ll find three tools that let you create a logo for free AND actually download it without having to pay (albeit with some restrictions). </p><p>And just another word of warning. We can&apos;t stress enough that even the best free logo designer software is no match for paid software. We really only recommended using the free logo designers below for experimenting, trying out ideas or for designing a logo for a hobby or personal project. When it comes to designing a real logo for a business that you expect to last, it&apos;s really worth paying to get it right!</p>

<p>Shopify is a paid-for platform that allows you to build your own ecommerce website, and is one of the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/best-website-builder-8133804">best website builders</a> available if you want to sell online. But you don&apos;t need to subscribe to Shopify to use the free logo designer Shopify Hatchful, which is a separate app that&apos;s absolutely free. You can use it within the browser, or download the free iOS or Android app.</p><p>You start by answering a series of questions about your type of business and the kind of style you&apos;re looking for, and then Shopify Hatchful generates a series of logos for you to choose from. Click on the one you like to modify colours, fonts and layout. It&apos;s fairly basic, but the logos look decent enough and, refreshingly, there are no hidden charges. </p>

<p>Squarespace is another website building platform that offers free logo designer software – in fact, it was one of the first web builders to do so. The Squarespace Logo Creator remains pretty basic, but then it is free. You tell the browser-based app your company name and it generates you a logo. You can choose a symbol from the Noun Project, and that&apos;s about it in terms of customisation. </p><p>The upside of so little in the way of customisation is that the process is extremely quick, just don&apos;t expect anything visually amazing. You don&apos;t need to be a Squarespace customer to use the service or to download a free low-res version of your logo, but you do need to be a customer to download a high-res version of your logo (you could always take out a 14-day free trial of Squarespace, and if you cancel before the end of the two weeks if the logo design is really all you need.)</p>

<p>Want to craft something original of your own rather than depend on an auto-generated logo? The website building platform Ucraft is one of the few to offer a Free Logo Maker that lets you do that. Click on the &apos;Text&apos; button, type your text and tweak the size, font, etc. Then add shapes, icons and/or backgrounds to complete your design. Of course, this is no Adobe Illustrator. Your options are limited, but it is very easy to use, and you can download a hi-res PNG version of your logo without paying a penny. (Note, that an SVG file costs $7.) </p>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What's the best logo design software?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>If you're a designer, the absolute best software for logo design is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adobe Illustrator</a>. This professional vector editing software is the industry standard for designing logos, offering you all the tools and AI-powered features you need. It operates smoothly with other Adobe apps, and services like Adobe Fonts and Adobe Stock. That said, Adobe Illustrator is quite expensive, and it's available only with a subscription. If you're looking for a cheaper alternative, <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Affinity Designer</a> is available as a one-off purchase.</p>
<p>However, if you have no design skills or experience, you really won't know where to start with either of these tools. In that case, we'd recommend <a href="https://www.canva.com/create/logos/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Canva Logo Maker</a>, which makes it very easy to create a logo using templates and a drag-and-drop interface.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What's the best free logo design software?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Free logo designers are very limited, and we'd generally avoid using them if at all possible. Getting the logo right is so important for any brand, company or organisation, that trying to save by using a free logo designer is a false economy in the long term.</p>
<p>That said, free logo designers do have their place and can at least be useful for coming up with logo ideas or for designing quick logos for personal, non-professional projects. For that, we'd recommend <a href="https://hatchful.shopify.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shopify Hatchful</a>. You don't need to be a Shopify subscriber to use it, and you have the flexibility of being able to use it in your browser or by downloading the free iOS or Android app.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How can I design my own logo?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>There are many different ways to design your own logo if you don't want to pay a professional designer (of course, if you have the budget for it, that's always the ideal solution to go for).</p>
<p>You can design a logo from scratch using software such as Illustrator, Affinity Designer or Canva, the first three tools on our list. This will give you the maximum flexibility in finessing your design and getting it just how you want it. If you're a non-designer, and don't know how to get started, read our guide to the fundamentals of <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/pro-guide-logo-design-21221">logo design</a> first.</p>
<p>If you find that too steep a learning curve, you may prefer AI-driven logo design software that does most of the work for you. These tools, from number 4 onwards on our list above tend to work in a similar way, asking you some quick questions about your brand and then presenting you with a selection of logo designs that you can modify to various degrees. You have a lot less control over the final result, but you do get a sometimes passable logo very, very quickly.</p></article></section>
<section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Do I own my logo design?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>If you use logo design software to create your own logo, who owns your design: you, or the software company? It's always worth checking the terms and conditions of your software provider (you know, the ones you usually skip past when downloading the tool). In most cases, you will own the design you create using the software. That's certainly the case with general graphic design software such as Illustrator or Affinity Designer, but it's always worth checking with the auto-generating logo design tools.</p></article></section>

They&apos;re becoming more sophisticated, and in 2022, some not only come close to matching Photoshop for many uses, but they also offer unique features of their own. </p><p>Of course, some do remain significantly less powerful than Photoshop, but even these have their place since they&apos;re usually a lot cheaper (sometimes even free). And after all, many people simply don&apos;t need all of the features that Photoshop offers, particularly if it&apos;s only to edit photos rather than make more advanced manipulations.</p><p>It&apos;s worth remembering that Photoshop is a lot more than a photo-editing program. It allows you to create original digital art and totally transform images with wholesale manipulations and compositions. In this guide, we&apos;ll focus on tools that offer those kinds of functionalities.

We&apos;ve evaluated them for features, ease of use, and of course value for money. See our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/how-we-test-software">how we test software</a> guide for more info.

<p>From its interface to its range of features, Affinity Photo is the closest thing to Photoshop that we&apos;ve seen yet. Aimed squarely at professional photographers and designers, it&apos;s fully compatible with Photoshop and other file formats. It also works out a lot cheaper than Photoshop in the long-run since you can buy it for a one-off cost rather than an ongoing subscription).</p><p>When we reviewed it, we also found Affinity Photo to be less demanding on hardware than Photoshop, although that may depend on what equipment you&apos;re using (it&apos;s been specifically designed to take advantage of the latest quad-core technology). It doesn&apos;t offer all the features of Photoshop, particularly in terms of features like neural filters, but there is still a lot to impress. We found the Personas – customised toolsets for different jobs – to be particularly handy.</p><p>Affinity Photo is available for both Mac and Windows, and there&apos;s a separate version for iPad. If you&apos;re looking for an affordable alternative to Photoshop, Affinity Photo is definitely worth investigating.</p><p>See our full <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/affinity-photo">Affinity Photo review</a> for more details.</p>

<p>If it’s a painting app for iPad you’re looking for, we highly rate Procreate. What started out as a basic drawing app back in 2010 has transformed over the years into a highly professional tool; so much so, it&apos;s even bagged itself a couple of <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/apple-awards-procreate">Apple Design Awards</a>.</p><p>Our testing found that the easy-to-use layout is packed with features artists will love, from true-to-life pencils and inks to advanced layer compositing and unique digital tools. Added palm support means you no longer have to worry about accidentally drawing over your canvas, and an ever-growing library of <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-procreate-brushes">Procreate brushes</a> will help you add flair to your artwork. </p><p>Procreate has full support for both first- and second-generation Apple Pencils, depending on your iPad model. And since 2019, there&apos;s been a dedicated iPhone version named Procreate Pocket. In November, the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/internet-loves-procreate-update">5.2 update</a> introduced some fantastic new tools, including 3D model painting, stroke stabilisation, page assist, and the ability to view 3D models in AR (see our reviewer using the tools in the photo above).</p><p>You won&apos;t find all the features you&apos;d expect from Photoshop for editing photos here, but for digital painting specifically, you&apos;ll have at least most of what you need. There’s a <a href="https://procreate.art/handbook/procreate" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">free handbook</a> on the Procreate website, featuring an overview of all the app&apos;s features and tools, to help get you started. </p><p>For more information, read our complete <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/procreate-3d">Procreate review</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to continual advances in web technology you don&apos;t always need a discrete app to do much of what you&apos;d use Photoshop for. Photopea, which runs in the browser, is a case in point.</p><p>Designed to be an advanced editor with pro tools, it bears a distinct resemblance to Photoshop and features most of the tools you&apos;ll need for everyday image work. It&apos;ll open most standard file formats such as JPG, PNG and RAW, and it&apos;ll accept Sketch, GIMP and even Photoshop PSD files.</p><p>Photopea supports layers and layer masks, lets you use blend modes, and features a stack of selection tools, from standard marquees through to a magnetic lasso and a quick selection tool. While it doesn&apos;t offer the sort of advanced features you&apos;d expect in Photoshop, such as content-aware fill, it still has a more than enough going on to keep most designers and artists happy, and it&apos;s completely free to use. </p><p>On the downside, it comes with ads, although paying for the premium version gets rid of them, and gives you extra levels of undo (60 rather than 30).</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a program that provides a true-to-life painting experience, look no further than Escape Motions’ Rebelle. This affordable program replicates traditional painting techniques – watercolour in particular – with absolute authenticity – making it a worthy contender on our list of Photoshop alternatives.</p><p>Our review found that Rebelle does exceptionally well at mimicking the way paint behaves in the real world, enabling you to simulate a drop of colour being blown and running in different directions. You can also specify the blow length, drip size and the amount of water you ‘use’ with your paints, while the Tilt option lets your colours run in any direction you choose. </p><p>The latest update, Rebelle 5, released last December, features a ton of advanced new features. These include pigment colour mixing, enabling you to paint with traditional pigments like cadmium yellow, alizarin crimson, ultramarine, and others; real-time zoom and the export of large canvases with sharp details; a Photoshop plugin; Express Oils, a new tool designed for concept art, sketching, and designing; life-like granulation effects; and time-lapse video recording of your painting process.</p><p>A highly professional painting software package, Escape Motions is keen to keep the focus of Rebelle on traditional media and the best way to present it in the digital realm. And we have to say it’s doing a darn fine job. </p><p>See our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/rebelle-5">Rebelle 5 review</a> for all the details.</p>

<p>ArtRage is another great option for those looking for digital painting that can pass for the real thing. It offers realistic oils, pencils, watercolour, canvas textures and other traditional media painting tools, many of which are fully customisable, replicating an old-school art studio in digital form. </p><p>Its makers say that ArtRage is "a canvas for thick, expressive oils and delicate watercolors, a sketchpad with a full set of pencils, and a sheet of paper with a stack of wax crayons all in one." </p><p>2021 saw the release of the latest version, Vitae for Windows and macOS. We found highlights include being able to virtually smear and blend thick oils to create natural colour gradients; sketch with pencils and shade with the edge of the tip; and create delicate watercolor strokes that react to canvas texture. Like most visual editing software, there are layers, blend modes, guides, grids, and perspective layout tools, and you can also use photos as references if you choose.</p><p>If you’re new to digital painting and looking for an affordable, intuitive program, ArtRage is an option seriously worth considering. The software is also available for iOS and Android, although you pay for those apps separately. </p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/review-artrage-5">Artrage 5 review</a> to find out more.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re after free software for digital painting, Krita is an excellent Photoshop alternative. As an open source program, it&apos;s been created by artists who want to give others access to quality, affordable software. And they&apos;ve focused on tools they know artists want and need. When we reviewed it, we were particularly impressed by the brush tools – there are 100 brush types, nine brush engines, and a brush stabiliser.</p><p>The latest version, Krita 5, fixes many previous bugs with tagging and loading resources as well as a handful of UI problems. It also makes the software faster and improves the gradient tools.</p><p>The interface is very similar to Photoshop, so users familiar to Adobe&apos;s software will find this easy to master. However, our test found that as a digital painting program, Krita does lack some of the specific photo editing features of Photoshop. For more details, see our full <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/krita">Krita 5.0 review</a> and our roundup of <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/how-to/krita-tutorial">Krita tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>Sketch is a professional vector graphics app for creatives that&apos;s created a huge buzz within the design community, and among web designers in particular, since its launch in 2010.  It&apos;s very flexible, supporting infinite zooming and vector shapes for multiple resolutions. You can build a new graphic from primitive shapes, or start a new one with the Vector or Pencil tool.</p><p>We&apos;ve found Sketch to have a pleasingly simple UI and many features similar to those of Photoshop and Illustrator, including layers, gradients, colour picker and style presets. Its popularity means there are also plenty of community-created <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/top-sketch-plugins-101517420">Sketch plugins</a> you can use to extend its functionality.</p><p>2021 saw a flurry of new features added to Sketch. These include improvements to real-time collaboration; in particular, developers can now view, inspect, and measure designs in any browser, on any operating system, all for free. Also, new document permissions allow designers to limit who can edit specific designs. </p><p>More broadly, new math operations make editing faster and easier, while Linked Data allows users to create better mock-ups and prototypes with real images and information that relate to their designs. For more details, see our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/sketch">Sketch 2021 review</a>.</p>

<p>A free, open-source Photoshop alternative, the amusingly named GIMP has been around for years (the name stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program, if you&apos;re wondering). Today it&apos;s available for Linux, Windows and Mac.</p><p>We think GIMP offers a wide toolset, similar to Photoshop in many ways, and is a great option if you&apos;re looking for a no-cost image editor. Our testing concluded that the interface differs somewhat from Photoshop, but there is a version available that mimics Adobe&apos;s look and feel, making it easier to migrate over if you&apos;re ditching Photoshop.</p><p>The full suite of tools includes painting tools, colour correction, cloning, selection, and enhancement. We find it ensures good compatibility too, so you&apos;ll be able to work with all the most popular file formats. You&apos;ll also find a very capable file manager built in, along similar lines to Adobe&apos;s Bridge.</p><p>As open source software, GIMP is constantly being improved. In December 2021, PSD support received various types of improvements. So if you tried GIMP before and didn&apos;t like it, it may be worth taking a second look. See our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/gimp">full GIMP review</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Pixelmator Pro is a kind of Photoshop-lite tool for Mac only, bringing together a photo editor, illustration and painting tool in one place. It offers non-destructive image editing, and supports features like tabs, fullscreen and split view. </p><p>The interface is nicely minimalist and so won&apos;t be confusing for newbies. Plus there&apos;s a great &apos;hidden interface&apos; option you can activate if you just want to see your image, with no distractions.  This Photoshop alternative is fairly limited on features compared with the original. But our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/software/review-pixelmator-22-21619196">Pixelmator review </a>found it&apos;s cheap, light, fast and fun to use, so if you just need to do basic Photoshop-like things every now and again, it might be just up your street.</p><p>An update in November 2021 introduced a Magic Background Eraser tool, allowing you to remove the background from any image with just a click, and a Select and Mask Tool, that lets you easily make advanced selections of challenging image areas such as hair or fur. Since then, Pixelmator Pro 2.4 Odesa, released in April 2022, introduced support for Apple&apos;s M1 Ultra chip for the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/apple-mac-studio">Mac Studio</a>. Note that there are also slimmed-down apps for iPhone and iPad called Pixelmator and Pixelmator Photo.</p>

<p>Pixlr is a suite of three tools that work in the browser and via iOS and Android apps. The first is Pixlr X: a photo editing tool that&apos;s great for giving your work a quick boost with one-click edits and artistic effects. If you&apos;re used to using Photoshop, you&apos;ll find its interface easy to pick up quickly, as it&apos;s very similar.</p><p>Pixlr E is a more substantial image editing app, with collection of useful editing tools. Finally, Pixlr BG is an AI-powered tool focused on one thing: removing backgrounds from photos. All three apps are free to use, with premium versions available to unlock advanced features. </p>

<p>If you need to make infographics quickly and easily for social media, Adobe Creative Cloud Express (formerly Adobe Spark) is one of the best tools around. It has over 10,000 templates to choose from and thousands of free license-free assets to smarten up your design. There&apos;s a basic free plan, but as our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/creative-cloud-express">Creative Cloud Express review</a> explains, you&apos;ll need a subscription to unlock all the many features available.</p><p>Creative Cloud Express can do a lot more than design just infographics, but it&apos;s the best tool that we&apos;ve found for that purpose for social. It uses a drag-and-drop editor which is super simple to use. Search through the templates to get the one you want, and then start editing. You can add your own background, change the text, add an image, introduce an icon and include your own logo (if you have one). When done, the infographic maker lets you resize for your favourite social platform with a single click, then download (we recommend saving in <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-cloud-storage">cloud storage</a>). Sit back and watch your infographic go viral. <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/plans?">Get Adobe Creative Cloud</a> now for Adobe&apos;s full suite of design apps. </p>

<p><a href="https://venngage.com/" target="_blank">Venngage</a> is one of the most popular picks for those looking for a dedicated tool for making infographics. Our first two picks as the best infographic makers can be used for all kinds of design, whereas Venngage was created specifically infographics in mind (although it covers diagrams and reports and other such pieces too). Thanks to this specialisation it offers a vast number of creative templates for the purpose (more than 7,500, in fact). </p><p>It&apos;s super-easy to use thanks to a handy image search feature, which makes finding and adding images to your infographics a breeze. Though there&apos;s a massive range of features available, including font upload and the ability to export in Powerpoint and even interactive PDF, many of these are only available as part of a Business account (there&apos;s a big jump between what you get from a Premium account and the Business plan). However, there is also a fairly decent Free plan, and the Premium subscription gets you everything you need to create attractive infographics with a highly professional feel.</p>

<p>The highly rated graphics tool <a href="https://snappa.com/" target="_blank">Snappa</a> is another one that we found super-easy to use, with pre-made templates galore and a library packed full of high-res images – over 4,000,000 to be exact. It lets you remove image backgrounds with a single click and has a range of text effects and graphics to drop in. You can even share to social direct from the program. There&apos;s a free plan (you can have one user, 6,000 templates and three downloads a month), and paid-for options from $10 per month offering more features.</p>

In this handy guide, we&apos;ll explain both how to download Adobe XD for free and how to purchase a full version either as a single app on its own or as part of an Adobe Creative Cloud All-app subscription.

In the case of Adobe XD, you can actually access a permanent, albeit more basic, version of the software without cost.</p><p>To get started, if you&apos;re completely new to the software, we&apos;d recommend starting with that. To download Adobe XD for free, simply click on the link or View Deal button in the box below – you&apos;ll be taken straight to Adobe to download the software, and you can get started with the free version straight away. You can always upgrade later. Or if you already have more experience in UI design and know about the software, scroll down further for details on how to purchase the full version of Adobe XD. </p><p>For more on Adobe software, see our guide to how to <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/download-photoshop">download Photoshop</a> and our guide to the best <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/adobe-deals" target="_blank">Adobe Creative Cloud discount</a>.

<h2 id="can-i-download-adobe-xd-for-free-2">Can I download Adobe XD for free?</h2>
<p>Yes. You can click on the link above to download a free version of Adobe XD. And this isn&apos;t merely a free trial like those offered on other Adobe products – it&apos;s free forever. It comes with some limitations, of course. Named XD Starter, the free version limits you to one active shared document, two editors and one active shared link. This is decent for trying out the software, but it isn&apos;t much good if you want other team members, stakeholders or clients to be able to collaborate on your designs.</p><p>To download Adobe XD for free, you&apos;ll want an Adobe ID, if you don’t have one already. This is easy to set up and free. Go to the <a href="https://account.adobe.com/" target="_blank">Adobe Account Page</a>, click &apos;Create Account&apos; and follow the instructions.

</h2>
<p>Adobe XD is a vector-based UX design tool available for macOS and Windows that supports website wireframing and creating animated, click-through prototypes. The software makes it easy to bring in existing design work from other Creative Cloud apps, such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator, using copy and paste. There&apos;s also a free companion app for iOS and Android that enable you to preview your designs on mobile devices: you can download this from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/adobe-xd/id1146597773" target="_blank">App Store</a> or the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.sparklerandroid&hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Google Play store</a>.</p><p>Note: you cannot make finished websites with Adobe XD; it&apos;s purely for prototyping and forming designs that are ready to code. If you do want a user-friendly tool for building live websites and have a Creative Cloud subscription, you can try Adobe Muse as an alternative; also check out our selection of the <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/best-website-builder-8133804">best website builders</a>.</p><p>Adobe XD is continually being updated, and users can access the new features automatically. The <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd/features/whats-new.html" target="_blank">latest features</a> (March 2022) include the addition of text hyperlinks and the ability to reorder component states to better organise them for easier navigation. </p>
<h2 id="the-best-alternatives-to-adobe-xd-2">The best alternatives to Adobe XD</h2>
<p>The main alternative to Adobe XD is Sketch. Launched in 2010, Sketch quickly became the digital design profession&apos;s go-to tool for mockups and prototyping. Indeed, Adobe XD was essentially launched in direct competition to it, and the two tools have very similar feature sets. However, note that Sketch is Mac-only, and no longer has a free tier, although it does offer a 30-day free trial. See our <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/reviews/sketch">Sketch review</a> for more details.</p><p>There are plenty more alternatives to Adobe XD, though, including Invision, Figma, Marvel and Framer X. Each have their pros and cons depending on your needs: check out our roundup of 8 <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/8-essential-tools-for-ui-prototyping">essential tools for UI prototyping</a>, to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="should-you-get-adobe-acrobat-standard-or-pro-2">Should you get Adobe Acrobat Standard or Pro?</h2>
<p>Adobe Acrobat comes in two versions. Adobe Acrobat Standard DC, for Windows only, offers all the standard PDF features that allow you to view, create, edit, sign, and convert PDF files. Adobe Acrobat Pro DC, for both Windows and Mac, adds in special features such as:</p>
<ul><li>Compare two versions of a PDF to review all differences </li><li>Turn scanned documents into editable, searchable PDFs </li><li>Advanced mobile editing tools</li><li>Validate and fix PDFs for ISO and accessibility standards</li></ul>
<p>We&apos;d recommend you download Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. It only costs a little more than Adobe Acrobat Standard DC, and you&apos;ll get the full feature set. Of course, if you use a Mac, it&apos;s the only option anyway.</p><p>Note that Acrobat Pro DC comes included when you download <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Creative Cloud</a>, Adobe&apos;s all-apps subscription package which also includes Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and more. In our view, a Creative Cloud subscription is the best-value way to get Adobe Acrobat Pro DC if you use other Adobe products.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-download-adobe-acrobat-for-free-2">Can I download Adobe Acrobat for free?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can download Adobe Acrobat for free, in the form of a seven-day free trial of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (see above. Note that you cannot get a free trial of Adobe Acrobat Standard DC).</p><p>You can cancel your subscription at any time during your week&apos;s trial via your Adobe Account page or by contacting Customer Support, and you won&apos;t have to pay a thing. Alternatively, if you like the software and decide to keep your subscription, you can just keep going.</p>

The latter option will cost you more, but gives you access to all of the Creative Cloud apps, along with a range of other benefits.</p><p>If the cost seems too high, bear in mind that Adobe often runs special promotions. We keep track of these in our constantly updated guide to the best Adobe <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/features/adobe-deals">Creative Cloud discounts</a>. Beyond that, there are always discounts for students and teachers (see below), as well as separate pricing for businesses, schools and universities.
