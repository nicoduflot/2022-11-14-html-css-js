                        La caméra multiplane est un système amélioré au sein des studios Disney pour donner un effet de
                        profondeur au dessin animé. Le premier concept de caméra multiplane a été créé et testé par
                        Lotte Reiniger pour son film Les Aventures du prince Ahmed (1926) mais le brevet a été
                        officiellement déposé par Bill Garity en 1933 dans le cadre de son travail pour Disney. La
                        première production est le court métrage Le Vieux Moulin (1937) de la série des Silly
                        Symphonies.

                    <p>
                        Le système a été créé par Bill Garity1,2,3 ingénieur aux studios Disney en 1933 pour donner un
                        effet de profondeur au dessin animé en utilisant plusieurs niveaux mobiles pour poser des
                        cellulos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cette technologie a été utilisée pour la première fois sur Le Vieux Moulin (1937) et sur les
                        longs métrages comme Blanche-Neige et les Sept Nains (1937), Pinocchio (1940), Fantasia (1940)
                        et Bambi (1942)3.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Le développement de cette technologie aurait coûté à l'époque 70 000 USD4.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Le système a été amélioré à partir de 1941 par Ub Iwerks, qui avait développé dans son propre
                        studio une version à la disposition horizontale des différents supports3. Après la fin de la
                        production de Bambi, son usage sera sensiblement amoindri en raison de son coût et de ses délais
                        d'utilisation5.

                        À la demande Ron Miller qui avait entendu parler de la Dykstraflex utilisée sur Star Wars que le
                        studio lance le développement du A.C.E.S6, le système de Matte scan a été amélioré pour intégrer
                        une caméra multiplane et plus de contrôle informatique jusqu'à devenir le système Automatic

                        Les cellulos sont placés à différentes hauteurs sur différents bancs-titres, des plaques de

                        Le cellulo correspondant au décor est placé tout en bas derrière ceux correspondants aux
                        différents personnages et éléments mobiles du plan. Ainsi, lorsqu'un élément se déplace, on
                        n'est pas obligé de dessiner ou bouger toutes les cellulos mais seulement les éléments qui
                        changent.

                        En haut du système, perchée à plus de 4 m de haut4, une caméra photographie l'image finale une
                        fois tous les ajustements faits.

                        On gagne alors en temps dans la fabrication du film et les éléments fixes ne donnent pas
                        l'impression de vibration qui serait apparue s’ils avaient été redessinés à chaque image.

                            It sounds amateurish to say that characters invent themselves, and in truth they don't.
                            That's just a short-hand phrase. Of course the author invents them. But while the creative
                            channel is being held open, all sorts of memories and thoughts creep out, somewhat to the

                    <p>
                        Pratchett has said Tiffany Aching "started with a girl lying down by a river, on the first page
                        of The Wee Free Men". In his youth, Pratchett was "fascinated" by a nearby chalk pit, and like
                        Tiffany knew how to read words before being able to pronounce them. The Wee Free Men features "a
                        lot of [his] past" in its descriptions.[2] A lot of Tiffany's understanding of the world is
                        based on Pratchett's own experiences.[3]
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        With Tiffany, Pratchett wanted to "restate" the purpose of magic on the Discworld and the
                        relationship between wizards, witches and others.[2] He included ideas of responsibility and
                        "guarding your society" as he felt it drew closer to the reality of a witch – that is, "the
                        village herbalist, the midwife, the person who knew things";[3] like a designated driver, a
                        witch is her community's 'designated sensible person'. Pratchett found a young protagonist
                        useful, because when one is young "you have to learn".[4] The name "Tiffany" was chosen
                        deliberately, to be poorly evocative of a witch.[5]

                        A young witch (9 during The Wee Free Men,[6] 11 in A Hat Full of Sky,[7] 12 and 13 in
                        Wintersmith,[8] almost 16 in I Shall Wear Midnight,[9] and in her late teens in The Shepherd's
                        Crown),[10] Tiffany hails from the Chalk, a Barony and a region of Downland Rimward of the
                        Ramtops. Her family the Achings are the tenants of the Home Farm of the local Barony, the de
                        Chumsfanleigh (pronounced "de Chuffley"). Her late grandmother, Sarah 'Granny' Aching (who died
                        2 years prior to the events in The Wee Free Men), was a shepherdess, and by Ramtop standards she
                        was also a witch, although witchcraft was frowned upon on the Chalk until Tiffany openly
                        practised it. Granny Aching was a friend of the Chalk's Clan of Nac Mac Feegles (an army of
                        tiny, tattoed in blue colour, rowdy, drunken and vaguely Scottish 'pictsies'), and they have
                        befriended Tiffany as the new "hag o' the hills". As Tiffany filled in as their Kelda (Queen)
                        for a short time, the Nac Mac Feegle continue to see her as their responsibility, and there is
                        no time in Tiffany's life since then which when they have not (in)discreetly watched her.

                        Tiffany begins her witching career at nine, upon being scouted out by the "witch finder" Miss
                        Tick, after things from Fairyland begin making an entrance. She later leads the Feegles on a
                        journey into Fairyland to rescue Wentworth, her toddler-age brother, as well as Roland, the
                        young son of the local Baron, from the Queen of the Elves. For this she earns the respect of
                        Granny Weatherwax, a significant achievement in itself. Although Tiffany is too young at the
                        time to be an official witch, Granny gives her an imaginary invisible hat to boost her
                        confidence. Such is the power of belief on the Disc that this hat keeps off the rain.

                    <p>
                        Two years later, Tiffany travels up to Lancre to be formally apprenticed to a witch, Miss Level.
                        During her time with Miss Level, Tiffany uses the words "see me" to exit her body and see
                        herself, believing it to be a harmless trick.[11] Her body becomes vulnerable to infestation by
                        a "hiver," (a gestalt entity of minds from the dawn of time) which uses her power to harm and
                        cause chaos, using Tiffany's suppressed thoughts and desires as a basis. She eventually manages
                        to overcome the hiver by giving it what it truly wants: the ability to die.

                        As a witch, Tiffany possesses First Sight, the ability to see 'what is really there' (as opposed to second sight, which shows people what they think ought to be there). She also possesses Second Thoughts, which are defined as 'the thoughts you think about the way you think'. Whilst other witches are said to have this trait as well, Tiffany also recognizes some of her thoughts as Third Thoughts (the thoughts you think about the way you think about the way you think), and Fourth Thoughts (the thoughts you think about the way you think about the way you think about the way you think). All these thoughts sometimes cause Tiffany to walk into door frames.

                    <p>
                        Like her grandmother, she appears to have a symbiotic, spiritual link with the hill lands on which she lives, and as such has shown herself to be strongly protective of the region and all its inhabitants. On several occasions, Tiffany has induced in herself a state of total mental clarity, becoming completely aware of every sensation, life-form and object around her, including the land itself. It is also hinted at that the Chalk itself can, likewise, 'Borrow' the witch it 'Chose', having once temporarily spoken through Tiffany, telling her childhood friend, Roland, that she would marry him (and later performing an ancient marriage ceremony on Roland and his fiancée, Letitia).

                    <p>
                        Tiffany has shown skill in many of the same areas of magic as Granny Weatherwax (though generally to a lesser degree): she has precociously mastered the art of Borrowing (the art of stepping outside one's own self), though Tiffany did not recognise it at the time, and merely used it as a means of viewing herself when without a mirror. The resulting vacancy of her body was what attracted the hiver to possess her in A Hat Full of Sky. In Wintersmith she demonstrates a high level of skill in the art of magical self-concealment, and also learns how to absorb heat from any available source (including the sun) and channel it out into the world, without being touched by it herself. She generally precedes the use of the latter art with a sort of mantra, in which she states that she willingly chooses to undertake the dangerous action, and is prepared to accept full responsibility for all its consequences. Also like Granny, she has great difficulty in constructing the magical devices known as 'shambles', though unlike Granny, she later overcomes this obstacle. Tiffany has also demonstrated an affinity for using fire, which she considers a friend (most Witches do not consider fire to have good associations for them in view of its history).

                        In I Shall Wear Midnight it is revealed that in the future, Tiffany is able to exert a limited influences over events throughout the timeline with the help of Eskarina Smith, the main character of Equal Rites.

                        Tiffany is very skilled at making cheese; and owns one particular Blue Lancre, named Horace, which habitually eats mice. She has read the entire dictionary, although she sometimes has difficulty with pronunciation. Tiffany also has a talent with languages, a side effect of the encounter with the Hiver. The occupation of her mind by the creature that collected minds has left her with shadows of those memories, including a deceased, didactic wizard named Sensibility Bustle, who translates any foreign word inside her head upon hearing or seeing it. Tiffany is also able to hear "Spill Words", the words almost spoken but left unsaid, a skill she learnt from Mrs. Proust. This skill is often mistaken for the ability to read minds.

                        At the climax of events in I Shall Wear Midnight, it is revealed that Tiffany, as the Witch of the Chalk, also has powers and authority not unlike a Justice of the peace; she is able to perform binding marriage ceremonies, and judge and deal out punishment(s) onto the deserving.

                        Tiffany is the seventh of the Aching children, and the second youngest, the youngest child being her only brother, Wentworth. Both her parents are alive, but she attracts little attention around the house, because she does her job well, which means nobody ever has to come and fuss over her, which in turn means nobody ever pays a lot of attention to her. While she doesn't particularly like her brother, she sets out to rescue him because he is her brother.

                    <p>
                        She is friends with several of the Nac Mac Feegle, including Rob Anybody (originally, but accidentally, her betrothed), Daft Wullie (somewhat clueless), William the Gonnagle, Hamish, and Not-as-big-as-Medium-sized-Jock-but-bigger-than-Wee-Jock Jock.

                        While training in Lancre, she attended a coven of young witches 'led' by Annagramma Hawkin. Tiffany and fellow coven members Lucy Warbeck and Petulia Gristle eventually acquit themselves well as witches; Annagramma, however, finds that her training, under the tutelage of Letice Earwig, had not been enough to prepare her for the reality of witching life, and her onetime coven subordinates agree to help her get on her feet.

                        Roland comes to have great affection for Tiffany and takes the role of the mythic hero, attempting to rescue her from the Underworld[11] and from the romantic attentions of the Wintersmith. Tiffany herself denies having any affection for Roland, but there are many signs that she does have feelings for him, even though she does not admit it until pressured to by Nanny Ogg. However, both eventually recognise that their both being different from everybody else did not mean they had anything in common, and Roland eventually married a local noblewoman (and latent witch) Letitia Keepsake.

                        During the fourth book, I Shall Wear Midnight, it is revealed near the end that she has entered into a romantic relationship with an intelligent young guard, named Preston, who aspires to study medicine at the Lady Sybil Free Hospital down in the city of Ankh-Morpork, under Dr. John Lawn, and further wishes to start a medical practice of his own up in the Chalk.
